09/12/2002,Commons,1,Mr Ben Chapman,"Wirral, South",Lab,If he will make a statement on the future aircraft carrier project.
09/12/2002,Commons,2,Dr Lewis Moonie,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"The future aircraft carrier project is progressing well. The second stage of assessment ended on  20 November. By the end of January 2003, we plan to announce which, of BAE Systems or Thales Naval Ltd., is our preferred contractor for the programme."
09/12/2002,Commons,3,Mr Ben Chapman,"Wirral, South",Lab,"Although I of course congratulate the Government on the biggest shipbuilding programme since world war two, this project in particular has the potential for massive effects for decades to come. In selecting the prime contractor, will my honourable Friend tell me how he plans to weigh various factors, such as the effect on future warship exports, on the United Kingdom supply chain and UK subcontractors and on UK design capability and the extent of UK content and jobs?"
09/12/2002,Commons,4,Dr Lewis Moonie,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I suppose the short answer would be ""very carefully,"" but my honourable Friend will want a bit more than that. Whichever of the contractors is successful, it is clear that throughout its design and manufacture the programme will sustain and create about 10,000 jobs across the United Kingdom. There will be up to 1,000 white-collar engineering design and managerial jobs, about 2,000 to 3,000 blue-collar jobs and a significant number of jobs throughout the supply chain. At the end of the day, the decision will be made on the basis of the track record of the two companies concerned, on how successfully they have performed in the past and are performing during the initial stages of the contract."
09/12/2002,Commons,5,Mr Mike Hancock,"Portsmouth, South",LD,"I am grateful to the Minister for his earlier response, but can he give a firm assurance that the Government will be able to write into the contract of the successful contender the insistence that all the yards currently in the bids will be given parts of the work for the two carriers? Can he also assure the House that the three aircraft currently designated to fly off the ships will be in service when the ships are in the water?"
09/12/2002,Commons,6,Dr Lewis Moonie,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"We are actually quite a long way from the ships being in the water and I am always a wee bit sceptical when Ministers stand up and make confident predictions, but it would appear from the success on both projects to date that the planes will be ready when the ships are operational. With regard to the yards bidding, it is difficult at present to say with certainty that everybody will get a share of the work. Obviously a certain amount of competition will be involved in deciding which part goes where. Furthermore, it does not take a genius to work out that if there are only three major sections and four yards are bidding, somebody will lose out at the end of the day. I can say, however, that I believe that all yards in this country that are capable of building those large modules will have a very good chance of securing work on the carriers."
09/12/2002,Commons,7,Syd Rapson,"Portsmouth, North",Lab,"Although it is MOD policy that the design and build of all Royal Navy warships will be carried out in the UK, can my honourable  Friend reassure the House by guaranteeing that the through-life support, which will last for 50 years, will also be carried out in the UK?"
09/12/2002,Commons,8,Dr Lewis Moonie,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"In short, yes."
30/01/2003,Commons,1,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the future aircraft carrier programme. The 1998 strategic defence review set out the need to improve the capabilities of our armed forces to meet the challenges of a changing strategic environment. The new chapter to the strategic defence review, which builds on our operational experience since 1998 and takes account of events that followed the 11 September attacks, has reinforced those requirements. Our maritime forces need the ability to project power still further afield. We have therefore set out our most extensive shipbuilding programme for more than a generation. In the next few years, six Type 45 air defence destroyers, six new amphibious warfare vessels and other essential support ships will enter operational service. Two new, larger, more versatile aircraft carriers will be central to those new maritime capabilities. They will have a vital role in a wide range of military tasks, from peace support operations to high-intensity war fighting. They will offer a coercive presence that could contribute to conflict prevention and provide a flexible and rapidly deployable base when our forces need to operate without host nation support. As I announced last September, those ships will carry the world's most advanced stealthy and supersonic jump jets the United States-United Kingdom project for the joint strike fighter. At the same time, I announced that we had chosen an adaptable design for the carriers, which will allow us to make best use of the ships over their projected life of more than 50 years. Both decisions show the Government's determination to equip our armed forces with the capabilities that they need. The programme is massive and technically challenging, with the two ships alone costing around £3 billion. It will provide employment for up to 10,000 people throughout the United Kingdom. The warships will be the largest and most powerful vessels ever produced for the Royal Navy. At around 60,000 tonnes, they are approximately three times the size of our current carriers. They will rank alongside the most formidable and complex weapons systems deployed by any country anywhere in the world. The competition for the prime contract has been closely run between the two bidders, BAE Systems and Thales UK. Both are to be congratulated on their proposals to deliver the key new capability to our armed forces. Both are major defence suppliers to the Ministry of Defence. They each make an important contribution to the United Kingdom's economy, providing investment and employment in manufacturing and key science and technology areas. Thales UK employs around 12,000 people throughout the United Kingdom, and BAE Systems, including through its joint ventures, employs approximately 51,000. A competition of such complexity and scale necessarily involves intensive scrutiny of technical specifications, value for money and wider industrial benefits. We have used a continuous assessment process  to evaluate both companies' work and performance. We have assessed their ability to keep to their project schedules and to establish an appropriate relationship with the Ministry of Defence team. That pioneering process has provided us with a wealth of information to help our decision making. Two key findings emerge. First, both BAE Systems and Thales UK have performed to a very high standard. There is no doubt that competition has led to major benefits and sharpened the performance of both companies. The competition process has produced impressive designs. Secondly, if the carriers are to enter service on time, both companies would need to augment substantially their available design resources to achieve the necessary maturity before manufacturing can begin. Our detailed analysis shows that each company has significant strengths. BAE Systems has displayed a sound understanding of the project's complexities in its project management and prime contracting, and has developed a good relationship with all the key shipyards. It also demonstrated the skills that are necessary to integrate the different systems into an effective warship. Thales UK has provided an innovative design that is flexible enough to meet our needs. It has strengths in a number of key areas, including in weapon and defence systems and the interface between the ship, aircraft and flight deck operations. We have therefore decided that, to deliver value for money and provide the best capability, it is important and, indeed, sensible to exploit all those strengths. We judge that a partnership appears to offer the best means of drawing in the necessary resources and expertise to deliver a programme of such magnitude. We envisage that this alliance will be led by BAE Systems as the preferred prime contractor, with responsibility for project and shipbuilding management. Thales UK will assume a major role as the key supplier of the whole ship design. We foresee that the Ministry of Defence will also take up a formal role in the alliance for those parts of the programme for which we are rightly responsible. That would involve the management of appropriate risk and contingencies and the provision of assets such as suitably trained manpower and the JSF aircraft. This innovative approach builds on the principles of smart acquisition and the defence industrial policy that was published last October. It will enable us to make the most of the resources and strengths of both companies and the skills and expertise of the Ministry of Defence project team. Both BAE Systems and Thales UK have indicated their willingness in principle to participate in such an alliance. The approach will be based on proper customer and supplier relationships, working collaboratively to achieve challenging targets. It will be underpinned by a robust contractual arrangement. Risk will be allocated to the party best suited to manage and mitigate that risk and the rewards will be shared so that it is in the interests  of all parties for the programme to succeed. Further work will be required with both companies to establish the detailed contractual arrangements. Subject to reaching a satisfactory outcome to these negotiations, and with subsequent confidence that the alliance is operating effectively during the final part of the assessment phase, we intend to reach the final investment decision in spring 2004. At that stage, we will place the prime contract and permit the alliance to move into the demonstration and manufacture phase, when the ships will actually be built. We remain fully committed to achieving our declared in-service dates for both ships in 2012 and 2015 respectively. I anticipate that honourable Members will be particularly interested in the shipbuilding element of the carrier programme. We believe at this stage that the best way forward is for the carriers to be built by a combination of four yards: BAE Systems Marine at Govan, Vosper Thornycroft at Portsmouth, Swan Hunter on Tyneside, and Babcock BES at Rosyth. The involvement of other yards has not been ruled out. The precise arrangements will be the subject of discussions between the alliance and the yards, to determine the best value for money and work load capacity. We anticipate that the engines will be provided by Rolls-Royce. It is clear that the benefits for the United Kingdom shipbuilding industry and its related supplier chain across the country are significant. I can assure honourable Members that, despite recent suggestions to the contrary, the vessels will be designed and built in the United Kingdom. This vast programme of work should create or sustain up to 10,000 jobs right across the country. It offers a significant opportunity not only for the shipbuilding industry, but for many small and medium-sized companies all around the United Kingdom. For example, the Bath-based company British Maritime Technology has played a key role in developing the Thales UK design. Other companies, such as specialist paint suppliers and engineering firms, will also have the opportunity to engage in the programme as it progresses. Ultimately, hundreds of suppliers right across the United Kingdom will be able to participate. Today's announcement by the Government is good news for our armed forces and good news for the nation's defence. It demonstrates the Government's support for the British manufacturing industry and for British jobs, and I commend it to the House."
30/01/2003,Commons,2,Mr. Bernard Jenkin,North Essex,Con,"I thank the Secretary of State for his statement and for giving me a copy in advance, but I have to say to him that this is not so much a decision as a fudge. The addition of two full-sized aircraft carriers to the Royal Navy's fleet, along with the introduction of the new joint strike fighter, will represent a huge increase in Britain's ability to project, sustain and protect military force anywhere in the world. So we welcome any progress towards the launch of the new ships, but we fear that this programme is now beset by uncertainty. First and not least, there is the vexed issue of money. Can the Secretary of State guarantee that the money for those ships will be available without the need to cut other programmes? The armed forces and the equipment budget are already overstretched. It is clear from the forward defence equipment plans that there is  far more on the Government's shopping list than current defence spending levels will support, alongside all of the UK's other defence commitments. Secondly, the Secretary of State describes his announcement as ""innovative"", but he is being a little modest. He has not so much announced a decision as the start of a whole new process: the formation of an as yet ill-defined alliance that is entirely unformed and agreed only ""in principle"". He remains committed to the in-service dates of 2012 and 2015 dates that are long after he is likely to have departed but if in a year's time his proposed alliance is judged not to be operating successfully, as he put it, where will that leave the Government's programme? The so-called smart procurement policy was meant to avoid the vexed issue of work sharing. This project started out as a clear competition, but has not the Secretary of State bottled out in the past few weeks by unexpectedly deciding to split the work between the two main competitors? Is he not now effectively saying that Thales won the competition, but that British Aerospace is the prime contractor and has to adopt the Thales design? What is the basis for deciding the split of work, and is it subject to ministerial direction? Will the contract be arbitrated under English or French law, and who will ultimately be responsible for achieving project milestones and holding to budget? Does not this decision artificially to split the contract have very serious implications for the way in which future defence competitions should be conducted? Is it not the truth that the Secretary of State could never have justified awarding the whole project to a French company, given that there is no possibility of the French Government's ever allowing British companies to compete on the same terms in France? Should he not have realised that at the outset, rather than discovering it only now? We recognise that Thales UK is a major UK investor and employer, and that work placed with it will create British jobs in British factories, but some work will certainly go to France. I merely ask whether the Secretary of State shares the anxiety of many in our defence industries that UK companies simply do not have the same opportunities to buy companies, and to compete in French markets on the same terms. In return for nominating Thales as a ""key supplier"" the company is still effectively owned and controlled by the French Government what is President Chirac giving Britain, except a regular kick in the teeth for the Prime Minister on issues such as agricultural reform, his outrageous invitation to President Mugabe and his determination to split NATO over the issue of Iraq? Will the Secretary of State now agree that the company to which he periodically refers as ""British"" Aerospace is in fact a British company? Will there now be an end to the unseemly public criticism of what is Europe's largest defence contractor and one of our biggest industrial employers and export earners, from which he has carelessly wiped millions in stock market value? This decision raises many questions about the future of defence procurement policy, which the Government will have to address. The final order for those ships is important for British industry and vital for the future of UK defence, but today's announcement by the Government has introduced more risk and more  uncertainty not just for this project but, by implication, for the entire defence equipment programme."
30/01/2003,Commons,3,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I am sorry that the honourable Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin), who speaks on defence matters on the Opposition's behalf, has yet again come to the House with a litany of anti-European in this case, anti- French rhetoric. He has a problem, because if he examines the NATO alliance, he will discover that a significant number of European allies are members of NATO, and we work with them regularly. I know that there are many in the Conservative party who would probably like it to revert to its state before the debate on the corn laws, but unfortunately, when the honourable Gentleman talks about projects for the 21st century, his arguments sound distinctly outdated. The key question that the honourable Gentleman must answer is what would the Conservative party have done differently from the announcement that has just been made. [Interruption.] In all the honourable Gentleman's rhetorical, anti-European flourishes from the Opposition Front Bench, I heard not a shred of a suggestion as to what exactly he would have done differently. [Interruption.] If he says "
30/01/2003,Commons,4,Mr. Deputy Speaker,NA,NA,Order. There is far too much chatter from Front Benchers on both sides of the House. We are trying to hear a reply from the Secretary of State.
30/01/2003,Commons,5,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I am grateful, Mr. Deputy Speaker. What the honourable Gentleman must say at some stage today perhaps he will have opportunities other than the one he has just wasted is whether he would have been prepared to jeopardise this vital programme for our armed forces and the benefits that flow across a range of British industrial expertise, by refusing to take advantage of the strengths of BAE Systems and Thales UK and the various bids that they made. If he is saying that he would choose one bid or the other, he is actually saying that he would rule out of consideration, and exclude from benefit to the UK's armed forces, the considerable expertise that each of those companies would make available. [Interruption.] I can hear mumblings on the Opposition Benches, so obviously in the course of his rambling response, the honourable Gentleman did not make all the points that he wanted to make. I invite him to think carefully about the ways in which such project negotiations are conducted, because if he did so he would see that the proposal set out is very clear, tight and well defined, and is clearly of considerable benefit to United Kingdom manufacturing industry. Let me comment for the House on just one aspect of the honourable Gentleman's obsessions: the reference to French law. Had he listened carefully, and had he thought for a moment about the benefits to the United Kingdom, he would have recognised, as do many of his honourable Friends, that that was a smear, perpetrated deliberately to arouse the anti-European, anti-French rhetoric that has come to characterise the modern Conservative party. If he does not recognise that that is a disgrace, there are plenty of people on the Benches behind him who do."
30/01/2003,Commons,6,Mr. Paul Keetch,Hereford,LD,"I, too, thank the Secretary of State for giving me an advance copy of his  statement. The Liberal Democrats believe that the new carriers that the right honourable Gentleman has announced today are essential to the United Kingdom's future expeditionary strategy. I congratulate him, and the Government, on procuring them. We firmly believe that it is right for the carriers to be built, but we must be careful about the spin on this. It reminds me of Lewis Carroll, whose Dodo said: ""Everybody has won, and all must have prizes."" We must be sure that the Government can demonstrate that the process has been competitive, not political. In other words, has the alliance turned over the nature of smart procurement? Will the Secretary of State outline what discussions he has had with his French counterpart about the new French carrier? Does the decision announced today open the possibility of any advantages for the Ministry of Defence in future co-operation and possible future contracts for British companies on that carrier? What discussions has his Department had with the two contractors about the building of a hybrid carrier that could land both conventional carrier aircraft and the STOL aircraft now being suggested? After all, that would ensure that there was proper co-operation with French and American aircraft carriers. Does the decision exclude such a possibility? Can the Secretary of State confirm, yes or no, that the recommendation from the Defence Procurement Agency was for a single prime contractor? Does not a single contractor represent a single point of control? Who will really run the project? Will it really be BAE Systems? Who will own the rights to the design of the future carrier: BAE or Thales? Can the right honourable Gentleman give a single example of an alliance producing a contract on time and on budget? In short, after a three-year contest, why have the Government decided on such an alliance? If it is such a good idea, why was it not decided on at the start of the contract? The Liberal Democrats believe that the future carrier programme is essential to our British military future, and we congratulate the Government on fulfilling their obligations under the strategic defence review. I hope that the alliance will work, but it will be for the Secretary of State to demonstrate that that design does not become one of our major overruns."
30/01/2003,Commons,7,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I am grateful for the honourable Gentleman's support I think. He asked a number of practical questions, and I shall endeavour to deal with them. Overall, I took his response to be supportive; if subsequent textual analysis reveals that I am wrong, I apologise both to him and to the House. The great advantage of the approach that we are adopting is that we get the best out of a vigorous competitive process. If there is any doubt in anyone's mind about the nature of the competition, they have only to look at the various press reports about it over the past few months. In that competitive process, real advantages have been brought to bear, in terms both of design expertise and, crucially, of allowing the Ministry of Defence to monitor continuously the process that each of the companies has adopted. That is unlike what happened in previous competitions, when the first that a Department would see of the competition would be the product at the end, and then it would have to take a decision between two or more finished products. We have been able to monitor the way in which each company has approached the competition, which has had benefits for the companies and, I believe, strong benefits for the country. That is why at this stage we are confident that we shall be able to incorporate the best elements of both companies in the alliance approach, while maintaining an interest on behalf of the Government in how they work together. There are other examples of such co-operation. Type 45 will be built in a co-operative way, and that, too, will involve the best expertise that the United Kingdom can bring to bear. It is not appropriate for me to comment on advice from officials at this stage, but I assure the honourable Gentleman that at every stage there has been absolute agreement within the Ministry of Defence about the best way forward. That has meant that we can be confident in the recommendations that we are making and the decisions that we are announcing to the House today. As for the hybrid character of the project, I dealt last September I think with the proposal that the carrier will be adaptable. It does not make sense at this stage, either militarily or financially, to develop a carrier capable of taking both types of aircraft, but we are ensuring that the carrier could be converted if necessary, given a further generation of strike aircraft, to accommodate a different type of aircraft. That will guarantee the lifetime utility of the platforms that we propose to build."
30/01/2003,Commons,8,Several honourable Members,NA,NA,rose
30/01/2003,Commons,9,Mr. Deputy Speaker,NA,NA,"Order. We do not have an indefinite amount of time available for further exchanges on the statement, so I appeal to the House for short, single-part questions and crisp answers."
30/01/2003,Commons,10,Mr. Bruce George,"Walsall, South",Lab,"I hope that the Secretary of State will not construe any mild criticism of his decision as xenophobia. I hope that the Defence Committee will soon inquire in more detail into the nature of the decision, but what I as an individual ask for now is some reassurance. The Secretary of State said that BAE Systems would be a prime contractor. Will it have the opportunity to choose systems made by BAE, and not simply be a prime contractor but have to choose all Thales systems? Does the Secretary of State accept that, as Sir Robert Walmsley said, a carrier is just a box? That is the easy bit. The difficult bit is the systems that go in it and on it and those are the bits that I want some assurances about. I want to be assured that genuinely British companies will have the opportunity of bidding for and winning the contracts for them. Finally, echoing the words of the honourable Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin), the shadow Defence spokesman, I really hope that this generosity and this alliance will be reciprocated. Otherwise, people will see it in rather more xenophobic terms."
30/01/2003,Commons,11,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I am grateful to my right honourable Friend for his observations. As he rightly says, it is the weapons  systems incorporated in modern fighting ships that are their key characteristic. I assure him that there will be vigorous competition to ensure that not only do we have the best equipment for our armed forces, but the need to promote and protect vital high-tech industries in the United Kingdom is satisfied."
30/01/2003,Commons,12,Sir Nicholas Winterton,Macclesfield,Con,"I welcome the procurement decision, but I strongly oppose the decision that the Secretary of State has announced to split the contract. I want to support British industry, and I have done so for all of the 32 years that I have been in this place. The French do not have a very good reputation for building large ships. How many jobs has the Secretary of State sacrificed to the French by splitting the contract, rather than giving the order to BAE Systems, whose proposal 1 have strongly supported all along?"
30/01/2003,Commons,13,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"The answer to the second part of the honourable Gentleman's question is that not a single job has been sacrificed to the French. As I emphasised, unless he and some of his honourable Friends are suggesting that Bath is now somehow part of greater France "
30/01/2003,Commons,14,Mr. Don Foster,Bath,LD,No.
30/01/2003,Commons,15,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"The honourable Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is protesting that that cannot possibly be the case, so the design work was concluded well within the territory of the United Kingdom. That will remain the position. However, I know that the honourable Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) is a strong and consistent supporter of UK industry. I am delighted to have his support for this proposal."
30/01/2003,Commons,16,Mr. Alan Campbell,Tynemouth,Lab,"Those of us with an interest in shipbuilding in the north-east and memories of the closure of the Swan Hunter yard some eight years ago will greet the announcement as excellent news for the region. Does my right honourable Friend agree, now that a Labour Government have created this opportunity for the revival of shipbuilding on Tyneside, that it is up to companies and the work force to make the most of it?"
30/01/2003,Commons,17,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I am grateful to my honourable Friend. I visited Swan Hunter some years ago and recognise the revival that has taken place. Opposition Front-Bench Members may bluster, but the previous Conservative Government did not come to the House once in 18 years to announce the construction of two carriers of this size and type."
30/01/2003,Commons,18,Rev. Martin Smyth,"Belfast, South",Ulster Unionist Party,"I regret that the Harland and Wolff yard was not included in the announcement, but may I welcome the inclusion of four British shipyards, along with Thales? They will contribute to the economy of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."
30/01/2003,Commons,19,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I am grateful for the honourable Member's support. Thales is an important employer in Northern Ireland, where the Ministry of Defence already has a ship under construction. We have played our part in respect of the people there, and want to continue to do so."
30/01/2003,Commons,20,Linda Gilroy,"Plymouth, Sutton",Lab,"In his statement, my right honourable Friend said that the involvement of other  yards, besides the four that he named for building, would not be ruled out. Will he give an assurance that the proposals for certain aspects of design, commissioning and through-life support that were part of the Thales bid by Devonport Management Ltd. are not ruled out? Will they still receive full and fair consideration?"
30/01/2003,Commons,21,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"As I said, the benefits of this massive programme will spread right across the UK. I do not rule out any contribution that can be made. Obvious benefits will accrue to certain shipyards as a result of my announcement, but there will also be real benefits across the UK, involving many companies situated far from the sea. It is important that we bear that in mind."
30/01/2003,Commons,22,Mr. Mark Hoban,Fareham,Con,"What reassurances can the Secretary of State give to Vosper Thornycroft, which employs many people across south-east Hampshire, about the share of the shipbuilding work that it will get as a result of today's announcement?"
30/01/2003,Commons,23,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"Clearly, as must be the case in any event, that remains to be negotiated. However, I am sure that the company, its employees and the people living in the immediate area will be delighted that the yard will be one of those responsible for the massive amount of work that will come to the UK. Following so closely on the work being done on Type 45, this is a very important opportunity for a significant UK employer."
30/01/2003,Commons,24,Mr. Frank Field,Birkenhead,Independent,"Thankfully, more than 1.5 million more people are in work than when the Government were first elected. However, that prosperity has not yet spread to all our shipbuilding constituencies. If the tide of joblessness is to be reversed, it is crucial that my area can win some of the subcontracting work. Will my right honourable Friend give some idea of the number of new subcontracting jobs that will be created by his announcement today?"
30/01/2003,Commons,25,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"The overall estimate is that some 10,000 jobs will be created or preserved by the announcement. Clearly, there will be significant opportunities in subcontracting, not least in areas of high expertise such as the one represented by my right honourable Friend. We shall monitor that very carefully as the benefits of these decisions spread throughout the UK economy."
30/01/2003,Commons,26,Angus Robertson,Moray,SNP,"May I thank the Secretary of State for the advance copy of his statement, and welcome the announcement of domestic procurement? Last year, the Ministry of Defence said that, in procurement terms, there was a shortfall to Scottish taxpayers of  670 million. How will priority be given to sourcing work to the Clyde, Rosyth, Greenock and Nigg, which has an outstanding fabrication tradition?"
30/01/2003,Commons,27,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"Given the very considerable benefit that will flow to Scotland as a result of an announcement made by a UK Secretary of State for Defence, perhaps the honourable Gentleman should say whether an independent Scotland under the leadership of the Scottish National party would contribute to the programme or even whether such a country would want to be defended by these ships. The policy of the honourable Gentleman's party is  to take Scotland out of NATO, so I assume that he would abandon any requirement that the ships be used. If so, he should tell the people of Scotland how his party would defend the country in that eventuality."
30/01/2003,Commons,28,Tony Worthington,Clydebank and Milngavie,Lab,"This is a very welcome announcement for Clydeside. It gives the area's shipbuilding industry the biggest boost that anyone can remember, and we must use the opportunity. However, will my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State clarify one point? He said that he sees the role of the Ministry of Defence as providing assets such as suitably trained manpower. I hope that that is so, as I do not think that either of the contractors realise how much education and training is needed to rejuvenate the industry. We must make sure that the education and training sectors can meet the challenge being set them."
30/01/2003,Commons,29,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"The matter that my honourable Friend raises has been discussed across Government, and a number of Cabinet colleagues are concerned to ensure that it is resolved in the way that my honourable Friend describes. Clearly, with a project of this kind following so closely the Type 45 announcement, the benefits to Scottish shipyards are obvious and palpable. Equally, however, as those benefits come onstream, we must ensure that we have the right sort of trained personnel to take advantage of what is a significant opportunity. I am grateful to my honourable Friend for his support, and I shall look to it again as we deal with the challenging tasks ahead."
30/01/2003,Commons,30,Richard Ottaway,"Croydon, South",Con,"I welcome the Secretary of State's interim statement, although the crunch statement will come in spring 2004, as I think he said. However, Britain is the world's fourth-largest economy, and it is the nation that built the generation of carriers that included the Eagle, Victorious, Bulwark, Hermes, Invincible, Illustrious and Ark Royal. How have we got ourselves into a situation that means that we have to rely on the expertise of a foreign country to produce the best possible contract? Will the right honourable Gentleman conduct an inquiry into what has gone wrong with our defence industry, to ensure that this embarrassing situation does not arise again?"
30/01/2003,Commons,31,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I shall say this once more, for the honourable Gentleman's benefit. The Bath-based company, British Maritime Technology, played the key role in developing the Thales UK design. It is based in Bath and, as far as I am aware, it employs people from the locality. I am not aware that there is a huge number of people in Bath of French origin or nationality. It would not matter even if there were, as the benefits of that excellent design will still flow to the UK. I am tempted to give the honourable Gentleman a detailed account of the failures of 18 years of Conservative government, when no warship orders on this scale were placed. There were massive cuts in the amount of money spent on defence, and a significant rundown in the equipment available to the UK's armed forces. This Government are having to make good that legacy."
30/01/2003,Commons,32,Mr. John Lyons,Strathkelvin and Bearsden,Lab,"Any fair-minded honourable Member will welcome my right honourable  Friend's statement. His name will be toasted on the Clyde and elsewhere this evening when the very good news gets out. Rolls-Royce's involvement is important and will be welcomed across the nation. I welcome the proposal to involve a project team. Will my right honourable Friend consider speaking to BAE Systems, which has listed 200 redundancies? It would be great if that threat could be removed and everyone could participate in the work."
30/01/2003,Commons,33,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I am grateful for my honourable Friend's fair-minded support for the project, and for the way in which he has pointed out the wider industrial benefits for Scotland's shipyards, and for companies such as Rolls-Royce that operate in England and Wales as well as Scotland [HON. MEMBERS: ""Northern Ireland.""] and Northern Ireland. The decision will be of real benefit to the United Kingdom and should be welcomed by all Members and by great companies in the UK and their employees."
30/01/2003,Commons,34,Mr. Don Foster,Bath,LD,"I share the Secretary of State's concern that the Conservative tirade against Thales totally ignores the fact that many excellent British businesses were involved in its side of the deal. I thank the right honourable Gentleman for his specific reference to the excellent work of British Maritime Technology, which is based in Bath, and assure him that today's announcement will ensure that the company can go forward with bids to do work in other countries as well as in the UK."
30/01/2003,Commons,35,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"That really is a complete answer to the xenophobic nonsense that we have heard from the Conservative Front Bench. We live in an increasingly integrated global economy, and unless Conservative Front Benchers recognise that, rather than sniping constantly at our partners and allies, they will have little future in the 21st century."
30/01/2003,Commons,36,David Cairns,Greenock and Inverclyde,Lab,"When I sat through many briefings from both companies, it was clear to me that each had major strengths. My right honourable Friend has outlined in his statement a creative and imaginative solution. May I make one specific point? In previous programmes on which there have been overruns, there has been a fault line between those who design the ships and the shipyard management. Is my right honourable Friend completely confident that that major part of the programme will be carefully managed so that those who hold the jobs that will undoubtedly come to the Clyde will create best-quality ships that will in turn attract other orders from overseas?"
30/01/2003,Commons,37,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"A key strength of the BAE Systems bid was its relationship with the shipyards and understanding of the problems posed once a project moves from design to manufacture. That is a strength of the company, and one that we identified as part of its contribution to the bid."
30/01/2003,Commons,38,Mr. Ian Liddell-Grainger,Bridgwater,Con,"The House has a habit of saying, ""It's good to buy British.- Can the Secretary of State confirm that the propellant for the 800 tonnes of ammunition that the ships will carry is made  by BAE Systems in my constituency, which proposes to move production to America? If buying British is best, will the Secretary of State ensure that the propellant continues to be made in the United Kingdom?"
30/01/2003,Commons,39,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"The range of competitive pressures on UK companies clearly leads them to source material from different places. What is important to the UK economy is that they should do so cost-effectively while guaranteeing the supply of equipment in this case, propellant. I assure the honourable Gentleman that the Ministry of Defence pays close regard to that."
30/01/2003,Commons,40,Mr. Ian Davidson,"Glasgow, Pollok",Lab,"As secretary of the all-party shipbuilding and ship repair group, may I say how much that group welcomes today's announcement? The carrier order is probably the biggest boost to British shipbuilding for many decades, and it is particularly welcome coming, as it does, against a background of siren voices of Conservative Members who said that it would never come to pass. Can the Secretary of State give us an idea how many carriers he thinks would be ordered by the navy of an independent Scotland? People on Clydeside will want to be clear about that when they realise that the jobs announced today have come while we are part of the Union. As we move towards Scottish elections I make the point not for partisan reasons, but for the sake of public information it is essential that people realise that. Given that the Secretary of State has announced a challenging organisational way of moving forward, can he guarantee that there will be no delay in the work, particularly in steel, because men on Clydeside are ready and waiting to start building the ships?"
30/01/2003,Commons,41,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I am grateful to my honourable Friend, and I shall of course not answer him in a partisan way. I must point out that in the role that he ably holds on behalf of the British shipbuilding industry, he last said that I had given British shipbuilding its biggest boost the last time I announced an order, which was the Type 45 order. I am grateful for his consistent observations, and I know that the Government are consistently grateful for his support."
30/01/2003,Commons,42,Mr. Ian Davidson,"Glasgow, Pollok",Lab,Only when you deserve it.
30/01/2003,Commons,43,Mr. Paul Keetch,Hereford,LD,Not always!
30/01/2003,Commons,44,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"We are always grateful for my honourable Friend's support. I have already dealt with the points that my honourable Friend made about Scottish nationalist policy. I recognise the SNP's difficulties in sustaining its argument when it comes to defence-related jobs. It is a great privilege to be Secretary of State for Defence for the United Kingdom. and I think that my honourable Friend made his point well enough. As for delays, I emphasise the need to ensure a mature design before any steel is cut. One reason for past cost overruns has been that steel has sometimes been cut before the design has been properly matured. That is why it is important to hold effective contract  negotiations over the next 12 months in order to secure a proper outcome for employees in and around our great British shipyards and for the Ministry of Defence."
30/01/2003,Commons,45,Mr. David Chidgey,Eastleigh,LD,"Returning to the Secretary of State's comments on the partnership role of the MOD in regard to trained manpower, I am sure that he will be aware that Vosper Thornycroft has headquarters in Eastleigh. In the package that it put forward in the bidding process in partnership with BAE Systems, Vosper Thornycroft offered to provide high-skilled training for 1,000 people over the course of the project. That is vital to the future economy of my constituency and the wider area. Can the Secretary of State assure the House that that part of the BAE Systems proposal remains part of the project?"
30/01/2003,Commons,46,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"It would not be right at this stage for me to give specific assurances of that kind. What I can say is that there will be enormous demand for high-skilled employees as a result of our decisions, and Vosper Thornycroft's investment and commitment to the skills of its work force has been enormously impressive as it has taken on a number of challenging contracts that ultimately come from the Ministry of Defence. I have every confidence in the company's ability to deliver on shipbuilding and on the training required for a skilled work force."
30/01/2003,Commons,47,Mr. Kevan Jones,North Durham,Lab,"I warmly welcome today's announcement, which is good news for the north-east economy and particularly for Swan Hunter on the Tyne, a company that was closed by the Conservative Government but given a bright future by Labour. Can my right honourable Friend assure us that the MOD and contractors work with organisations such as Northern Defence Industries to ensure that the maximum number of small and medium-sized enterprises can obtain work from the massive contract, which will be a great boost to the north-east in general."
30/01/2003,Commons,48,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"I have been in regular correspondence with Northern Defence Industries, which performs a valuable role on behalf of the defence industry and defence companies in the north-east. As one who represents an entirely land-locked constituency, I can say that one of the significant consequences of the announcement is that the benefits clearly available to the north-east and other shipbuilding areas flow right across the United Kingdom."
30/01/2003,Commons,49,Mr. Henry Bellingham,North-West Norfolk,Con,"The Secretary of State did not point out that a commitment to build two strike carriers appeared in the 1997 Tory manifesto. I am glad that he has caught up with our plans and ambitions. Why is the Secretary of State withdrawing Sea Harriers before the two strike carriers come into commission? Will that not leave the Royal Navy vulnerable? Would it not be possible to bring forward the in-service dates, given that 2012 is a long way off'? After all, it took the Germans just two years to build Bismarck and the Americans two and a half years to build USS Missouri. I appreciate that those were less sophisticated vessels, but is there any chance of bringing forward the in-service date?"
30/01/2003,Commons,50,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"The honourable Gentleman unfortunately overlooked the fact that the two huge new carriers will  be equipped with the latest and most technologically advanced stealthy aircraft the joint strike fighter. I would be more enthusiastic about his questions if, rather than just talking about investment, he had been more enthusiastic about the massive investment that the Government have made."
30/01/2003,Commons,51,John Robertson,"Glasgow, Anniesland",Lab,"As the Member of Parliament who represents the Scotstoun yard, I hope that its name was missing from my right honourable Friend's statement only because Govan includes Scotstoun. I welcome the statement with open arms as it is good news for the Clyde and the country as a whole, but I am slightly disappointed that BAE Systems did not win the design part of the contract. In Scotstoun, a magnificent design office has been set up, especially for the Type 45 destroyers. It is an unmitigated success, but with the announcement of 265 job losses last week, I am concerned that there might be problems for that drawing office in years to come."
30/01/2003,Commons,52,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,My honourable Friend has been a constant champion of the Clyde and has argued long and successfully for precisely the kind of investment that we are now able to make in relation to the Clyde and BAE Systems' role there. I know that my honourable Friend will continue to ensure that his constituents are properly represented in guaranteeing that the kind of work available to them will continue long into the future.
30/01/2003,Commons,53,John Thurso,"Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross",LD,"Although I generally welcome the jobs that will be coming to Scotland, may I draw the Secretary of State's attention to the potential of the Nigg yard in Easter Ross? Given that the people of Easter Ross have borne with fortitude the inconvenience of the bombing range at Tain, would it not be a just reward for some of the jobs from the contract to come to Easter Ross, too?"
30/01/2003,Commons,54,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"In my statement, I made it clear that the involvement of other yards was not ruled out. I have already pointed out, in response to a question from one of my honourable Friends, that I anticipated a significant amount of subcontract would benefit parts of the UK other than those that I have identified specifically so far. I am sure that the honourable Gentleman will be able to make representations in due course."
30/01/2003,Commons,55,Andy King,Rugby and Kenilworth,Lab,"I, too, welcome my right honourable Friend's statement. I am extremely concerned on behalf of the 3,000 workers at Alsthom in Rugby, 200 of whom are to be made redundant in March owing to the failure of international contract and who will be greatly relieved that there will be work for the manufacturing industry. As my right honourable Friend said, the contracts relate not only to shipyards but to manufacturing as a whole. How many jobs are there likely to be in the manufacturing industry, especially at Alsthom, which is a major part supposedly of the foreign business partnership?"
30/01/2003,Commons,56,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"As I have already indicated, we anticipate that about 10,000 jobs will be either created or preserved as a result of the announcement. There will be significant  opportunities for landlocked constituencies such as that of my honourable Friend and indeed mine to benefit from the subcontract work that will flow from these decisions. I look forward to hearing from my honourable Friend that that is indeed the case for his constituency."
30/01/2003,Commons,57,Mr. Mark Francois,Rayleigh,Con,"Does the Secretary of State agree that the welcome for his statement from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench was a combination of four classic naval commands full ahead, full astern, abandon ship, and make smoke all at the same time? May I ask the right honourable Gentleman about the implications of his announcement for procurement policy? The history of defence procurement under Governments of all colours is littered with examples of projects that went horribly wrong because it was never clear who was actually in charge. How can the Ministry of Defence credibly run future competitions if bidders see that despite all their efforts and irrespective of the merits of the two bids in this case Ministers can intervene at the last minute to create what is in effect a shotgun marriage between two different bids?"
30/01/2003,Commons,58,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"If the honourable Gentleman will forgive me for saying so, there might be a fifth naval command that applies to the Conservative party: take to the lifeboats. As far as "
30/01/2003,Commons,59,Mr. Mark Francois,Rayleigh,Con,Answer the question.
30/01/2003,Commons,60,Mr. Keith Simpson,Mid-Norfolk,Con,It was supposed to be a joke very funny.
30/01/2003,Commons,61,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,I am grateful for all the applause I can get. I dealt with the specific question put by the honourable Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) in my answer to the Opposition spokesman. By incorporating the best elements of both bids we obtain the best British manufacturing contribution to this excellent British project.
30/01/2003,Commons,62,Mr. John Burnett,Torridge and West Devon,LD,"I foresee that the robust contractual arrangements that the Secretary of State described will provide a rich harvest for the legal profession in due course. The Secretary of State listed four shipyards where the main sections of the carriers will be built. Will he confirm that all UK shipyards, including Appledore in my constituency, will have a fair opportunity to tender for all subcontract work for the vessels?"
30/01/2003,Commons,63,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"Having just answered a similar question from one of the honourable Gentleman's honourable Friends in relation to a different yard, I can assure him that the same opportunities will be available. I am sure that his former colleagues in the legal profession will welcome the contractual work that the decision offers."
30/01/2003,Commons,64,Dr. Vincent Cable,Twickenham,LD,"Now that BAE Systems has won this major and lucrative contract, will the company be required to honourableur outstanding cost overruns on existing contracts, such as the submarines and Nimrod, thereby sending a clear signal to all  partners in the aircraft carrier contract that contractual failure will be penalised and not automatically paid for by the taxpayer?"
30/01/2003,Commons,65,Geoffrey Hoon,The Secretary of State for Defence,Lab,"It has never been suggested that, under existing contracts, the taxpayer will automatically have to fund any cost overrun. Indeed, that is central to the discussions that are being held between the Ministry of Defence and the company concerned. I can assure the honourable Gentleman that this contract has been dealt with by both companies in an extremely professional and sophisticated way, and that the United Kingdom should be grateful that there are two companies operating in the country that are capable of producing such outstanding work."
02/03/2004,Lords,1,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,"Whether, following the early withdrawal from service of HMS ""Ark Royal"", they are confident that there will be no gap in aircraft carrier capability should a future carrier be delayed into service."
02/03/2004,Lords,2,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, before I answer the Question, I hope that the House will forgive me if I mention briefly Lord Vivian who, in the old days, would be asking the Question. He was my Front-Bench Opposition counterpart for all of the time that I have been in this job. He performed his job in a fair, gentlemanly and really gallant way. The noble Lord would never take any unfair criticism of the Armed Forces, in which he served with such distinction. The House will very much miss him. "
02/03/2004,Lords,3,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"The decommissioning date for HMS ""Ark Royal"" has not been brought forward. On current plans it remains towards the end of 2013. The Government's intention is that there will be no gap in our aircraft carrier capability and that the future aircraft carriers will replace the Invincible Class ships, as expected, in a phased replacement programme. The target in-service date for the first future aircraft carrier remains 2012."
02/03/2004,Lords,4,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,"My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for those gracious and generous word about my noble kinsman Lord Vivian. He worked tirelessly and effectively to represent the best interests of the Armed Forces. As the Minister said, the House will miss him. "
02/03/2004,Lords,5,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,"Regarding the Question, I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Any gap would have serious consequences for the retention of naval and aviation skills, manpower and recruiting and complete subordination to allied forces in operations. Can the Minister assure us that HMS ""Ark Royal"" and HMS ""Illustrious"" would be kept on in the event of delays?"
02/03/2004,Lords,6,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, I give an assurance that we will never allow the position to develop whereby we do not have the aircraft carrier protection and force that we require. So I can give the noble Lord that assurance."
02/03/2004,Lords,7,Lord Boyce,Lords,Crossbench,"My Lords, would the Minister add to his answer by giving us an assurance that there will be a carrier air group to go on board the carriers the  ships? In other words will the Sea Harrier be able to run on, or will the new aircraft be available to ensure that there will not only be no gap in hulls but also no gap in carrier air group?"
02/03/2004,Lords,8,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, I can also give the noble and gallant Lord that assurance. When the new aircraft carriers come on stream, it is essential that there is air group available because it is a crucial part of the force that it represents."
02/03/2004,Lords,9,Lord Tomlinson,Lords,Lab,"My Lords, would my noble friend agree that, although his answer is welcome, if the public expenditure policies of the Conservative Party were put into effect it would imply a public expenditure cut in the defence budget of about 1.5 billion? If it proposes to defend the defence budget, that would mean even greater public expenditure cuts elsewhere, unless the right honourableurable Member for Folkestone changes his mind on public expenditure policy as rapidly as he changes his mind on participation in the Butler committee."
02/03/2004,Lords,10,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, having listened for a number of years to Opposition spokesmen who always genuinely ask for more resources for defence, it was a shock to the system to hear the right honourableurable Oliver Letwin announce his spending plans. I confirm that there would be a reduction in defence spending by having a standstill. I look forward to hearing in due course, perhaps later than sooner, where the Conservatives' defence cuts will be."
02/03/2004,Lords,11,Lord Redesdale,Lords,LD,"My Lords, I wish to associate noble Lords on these Benches with the comments made about Lord Vivian. He cared deeply about defence and the Ministry of Defence. "
02/03/2004,Lords,12,Lord Redesdale,Lords,LD,"I know that an overrun is unlikely in our wonderful age of procurement, as we have not seen overruns in other fields such as aircraft or radios. However, if there was an overrun in the carrier programme, would that mean that we would have to rely on the American or French carrier fleet to plug the gap in our defence capability?"
02/03/2004,Lords,13,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, it would not mean that at all. We have successful aircraft carriers and we will continue to have them. I look forward to hearing where the Liberal Democrat cuts in defence will come. Will they involve an aircraft carrier or two?"
02/03/2004,Lords,14,Lord King of Bridgwater,Lords,Con,"My Lords, following the answer given to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, will the Minister confirm who will provide air cover on the carriers in advance of the time that the new carriers become available? There has been a suggestion that if the Sea Harriers are withdrawn it will be provided by frigates. However, there is now a suggestion that the frigate fleet may be reduced significantly. Will the noble Lord clarify the point he made about air cover for the carriers?"
02/03/2004,Lords,15,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, the noble Lord need not concern himself too much on that. We will always  make certain that our carrier fleet is protected. While the existing carriers are still in operation, the GR7s and GR9s will take on the role that the FA2s maintained so well for so long."
15/12/2004,Lords,1,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,When an announcement will be made of the appointment of the physical integrator for the two new Royal Naval aircraft carriers.
15/12/2004,Lords,2,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, the process to select the physical integrator for the future aircraft carrier project is ongoing, and we anticipate announcing the outcome shortly."
15/12/2004,Lords,3,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,"My Lords, I very much hope that an announcement for such a high-profile project will be made to Parliament first, and not to the media after we have risen. What will the role of the physical integrator be? How will it relate to the existing members of the alliance? Will it be risk-sharing or just taking a fee?"
15/12/2004,Lords,4,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, it is anticipated that each of the two new aircraft carriers will be the equivalent of building approximately seven to eight Type 45 destroyers, which demonstrates how large they will be. Building and physically integrating the vessels is one of the biggest challenges facing the project. The role of the physical integrator is to help to strengthen that aspect of the project. We expect whoever is appointed to work with all potential shipyards four have been named manufacturing facilities and alliance participants to draw up a cost-effective strategy covering the manufacturing element of the programme. Among the core requirements are likely to be innovation, the prioritisation of design  activities, block integration and management of the ship-build strategy. The role of the physical integrator will not be limited to those tasks."
15/12/2004,Lords,5,Lord Craig of Radley,Lords,Crossbench,My Lords 
15/12/2004,Lords,6,Lord Redesdale,Lords,LD,My Lords 
15/12/2004,Lords,7,Noble Lords,NA,NA,Cross Bench!
15/12/2004,Lords,8,Lord Craig of Radley,Lords,Crossbench,"My Lords, when are the two vessels expected to be in service? Is the delay in appointing the physical integrator likely to affect the forecast dates?"
15/12/2004,Lords,9,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"No, my Lords. Our planned dates remain 2012 and 2015. We are determined to reach the right decision on who should be the physical integrator. It is more important to get it right than to rush it."
15/12/2004,Lords,10,Lord Redesdale,Lords,LD,"My Lords, if the service date is to be 2012 in the NAO report it was left blank what role will the physical integrator take in risk management? Without firm targets on when the ships are to be in service, the risk management might well go out of control, as has happened in so many other projects."
15/12/2004,Lords,11,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, under the alliance structure that we are setting up for this very large procurement, risk management and risks and rewards will be undertaken and accepted by all those who belong to the alliance. That will of course include the physical integrator, alongside the Ministry of Defence, BAe Systems and Thales. Anyone else who is a member of the alliance will be in the same position. I want to make it absolutely clear that the physical integrator will be part of the alliance."
15/12/2004,Lords,12,The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth,Lords,Bishops,"My Lords, reluctant as I am to put the Minister on the spot at a sensitive time, may I none the less ask for reassurance on the importance of the issue not only for the Royal Navy but for the future of the shipbuilding industry in different and sometimes rival parts of the country?"
15/12/2004,Lords,13,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, the right reverend Prelate never puts me on the spot, and it is always a sensitive time. We remain fully committed to the aircraft carrier programme, which represents a huge step up in military capability for our Armed Forces. The carriers will be the biggest and most powerful warships ever constructed in the UK. They will be built in the UK under a policy that the previous government and this Government have both adopted. That is very good news for British defence and, in particular, for the British shipbuilding industry."
15/12/2004,Lords,14,Baroness Trumpington,Lords,Con,"My Lords, what is a physical integrator? Could I qualify to be one?"
15/12/2004,Lords,15,Noble Lords,NA,NA,Oh!
15/12/2004,Lords,16,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, I told the House that the competition was ongoing. If the noble Baroness would  like to put in a late bid, I am sure that she would stand a very good chance. I did my best to describe what a physical integrator was or should be to the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever; it looks like I did not totally succeed."
15/12/2004,Lords,17,Lord Mayhew of Twysden,Lords,Con,"My Lords, are the Government absolutely committed to a particular size for the ships? If so, what is it?"
15/12/2004,Lords,18,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, we are not committed to an absolute size. If the noble and learned Lord will excuse the expression, size is not of the greatest importance here. What matters is the capability that the ships have to do the important job that we have determined they should do and which most people agree is critical for our future forces' structure. They will be the largest ships that we have ever constructed."
15/12/2004,Lords,19,Lord Berkeley,Lords,Lab,"My Lords, I presume that the physical integrator will make sure that the two halves of the ship fit together to the same size."
15/12/2004,Lords,20,Noble Lords,NA,NA,Oh!
15/12/2004,Lords,21,Lord Bach,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Ministry of Defence,Lab,"My Lords, my noble friend has great expertise in the railway industry. Of course they will."
18/01/2007,Lords,1,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,"When the Royal Navy future carrier demonstration phase is expected to complete, and when the main investment decision is expected to be taken."
18/01/2007,Lords,2,Lord Drayson,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, I have made clear to the Aircraft Carrier Alliance that time is now critical. I am looking to get a robust, affordable deal negotiated quickly to allow a main investment decision to be taken as soon as possible."
18/01/2007,Lords,3,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,"My Lords, will the Minister quash strong rumours coming out of the MoD that these continual delays in signing a full contract are just the first step towards cancelling the carriers? Despite the Prime Ministerâs commitment to spend more on defence, we heard at Question Time yesterday that he is only one of a number of contributors to the debate on the Comprehensive Spending Review. As the Chancellor is no friend of the Armed Forces and we are fighting two wars on a peace-time budget, will the Minister give those serving in the Royal Navy some hope that the carriers will not be sacrificed to pay for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan?"
18/01/2007,Lords,4,Lord Drayson,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, I am happy to give the noble Lord that assurance. He should consider the rumours quashed."
18/01/2007,Lords,5,Lord Craig of Radley,Lords,Crossbench,"My Lords, it is now two years or more since the Royal Navy Sea Harrier force was withdrawn. The date of introduction of the new carriers looks like slipping even further to the right. Is the Minister satisfied that the Royal Navy will have air crew and engineers in sufficient numbers and of sufficient expertise to man aircraft for these new aircraft carriers?"
18/01/2007,Lords,6,Lord Drayson,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"Yes, my Lords; I am happy to give the noble and gallant Lord that assurance. I do not accept that the dates for the introduction of the new aircraft carriers have moved to the right. I am happy to reiterate the central importance of the carrier strike capability the combination of the aircraft and the ships to the countryâs future defence posture. It is set out clearly in the Strategic Defence Review and it remains the case."
18/01/2007,Lords,7,Lord Garden,Lords,LD,"My Lords, can the Minister tell us roughly what proportion of the cost of the overall carrier programme he expects to be committed at the main gate? Might it be prudent I choose my words carefully perhaps to accept that we have had so much slippage already that he may want to wait until a new Prime Minister is in the chair?"
18/01/2007,Lords,8,Lord Drayson,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, I think I can be absolutely clear to the House on this point. As I said, the aircraft carriers are central to the defence posture. In the defence budget as a whole there is a budget for the replacement of the aircraft carriers. The key issue now is reaching agreement with industry on the price and the delivery of the carriers. As I said in my Answer, I am pushing very hard to reach an agreement that will deliver the carriers to cost and to time. For that to happen there needs to be consolidation in the industry. I am very pleased to see that that is now starting to happen. I am pleased also to see the progress we have made in the collaboration with France. We now have a common design for both the French and the British aircraft carriers which has been agreed and has involved no delay to the British aircraft carrier project, and at no increase in cost. That is an important achievement."
18/01/2007,Lords,9,Lord Foulkes of Cumnock,Lords,Lab,"My Lords, can my noble friend confirm that the statement made by the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is no friend of the Armed Forces is entirely untrue, not least because he has a substantial constituency interest at Rosyth?"
18/01/2007,Lords,10,Lord Drayson,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the opportunity to make that point. It is clear to anyone who has listened carefully to what the Chancellor has said that he is a friend of the Armed Forces."
18/01/2007,Lords,11,Lord Stewartby,Lords,Con,"My Lords, without in any way wishing to suggest that the specification for the new carriers should fall short of meeting the operational requirement, may I ask the Minister to bear in mind that, over the years, the biggest contributor to delay and cost overruns in major procurement projects has been the constant tweaking of the technical requirements?"
18/01/2007,Lords,12,Lord Drayson,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right. Industry made clear to me last year that unless the Navy could clearly close off the specification by the end of last March, it would not be able to meet the timescales we are looking for. I was very pleased and, in fact, impressed that the Royal Navy was able to meet that target."
18/01/2007,Lords,13,Lord Burnett,Lords,LD,"My Lords, DML Plymouth Appledore has an enviable record of excellence in the design, construction and refitting of warships. There has been speculation on the ownership of that company. The Government have a golden share. It is very important that that speculation is put to an end as soon as possible. Will the Minister let the House know exactly when the ownership of that vital company will be resolved?"
18/01/2007,Lords,14,Lord Drayson,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, the noble Lord is right: it is a very important issue. That base is important to the maintenance and refuelling of our nuclear submarines. It is very important for the strategic nuclear deterrent. We are not going to take any chances with that capability. We have been concerned about recent developments relating to the ownership of that yard. We are very focused on getting those resolved very quickly indeed."
18/01/2007,Lords,15,Lord Roberts of Conwy,Lords,LD,"My Lords, welcome as the collaboration with France in the design of these vessels is, will any contract entered into by the French Government have a bearing on any contract that the British Government might enter into?"
18/01/2007,Lords,16,Lord Drayson,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, the advantage of the collaboration with France and of the important step forward in the French using the British aircraft carrier design and we are working very closely together is the economies of scale which can be achieved in procuring three aircraft carriers rather than two and the sharing of benefits in savings and efficiency between the two countries. So it has an implication in that sense."
18/01/2007,Lords,17,Lord Marlesford,Lords,Con,"My Lords, my noble friend Lord Astor made an important point when he said that we are fighting two wars. Does the Minister recognise this huge expenditure and its consequences for the procurement programme? He recently explained to me that the first Gulf War cost us  2.5 billion, of which we got  2 billion back. The current activities are costing us about  4 billion, but there is very little sign of our getting anything back from anyone. Do the Government recognise fully that before they commit British forces to fighting operations, they must take into account the impact on procurement of crucial materiel for the effectiveness of the Armed Forces?"
18/01/2007,Lords,18,Lord Drayson,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, I can assure the House that all our decisions on equipment procurement take these matters of operations fully into account. They are absolutely central to every decision we take."
25/06/2007,Lords,1,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,How they intend to proceed with the future aircraft carrier project.
25/06/2007,Lords,2,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, I am sure that the whole House will join me in offering sincere condolences to the families and friends of Corporal John Rigby, who was killed on Friday during operations in Iraq, and of Drummer Thomas Wright, who was killed yesterday during operations in Afghanistan. "
25/06/2007,Lords,3,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,We intend to start building the two new aircraft carriers once we have agreed a robust and affordable deal.
25/06/2007,Lords,4,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,"My Lords, we, too, send our condolences to the family of Drummer Thomas Wright, and our thoughts are with those who were injured in the same explosion in Afghanistan. We also send our condolences to the family of Corporal John Rigby, particularly his twin brother Will, who was serving in the same battalion of the Rifles in Basra and will accompany his brotherâs coffin back to Britain. "
25/06/2007,Lords,5,Lord Astor of Hever,Lords,Con,"Last year, the Minister told the House that industry consolidation was a precondition for signing the contract on the carriers, but the industry says that there can be no further consolidation unless the carriers are ordered. For how much longer are the Government content to play poker with the industry, with thousands of jobs and the future of the Royal Navy at stake? Do they still want the carriers?"
25/06/2007,Lords,6,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, we absolutely want the carriers, and are prepared to play poker for as long as it takes to get them on the terms that we want."
25/06/2007,Lords,7,Lord Chidgey,Lords,LD,"My Lords, we, too, on these Benches send our condolences to the families of the latest casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq, particularly those from the old Royal Green Jackets now the Rifles who were based at a depot in my old constituency near Winchester. "
25/06/2007,Lords,8,Lord Chidgey,Lords,LD,"Do the Government continue to support a planned and managed approach to the restructuring of the warship-building industry and the significant benefits that it provides, including substantial savings, the de-risking of projects, the achievement of the future carrier target price, and the optimisation of export opportunities? What impact would a decision not to go ahead with the future carrier programme have on Britainâs international obligations and strategic ability to project power?"
25/06/2007,Lords,9,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, this Government have invested more in building up a modern surface and submarine fleet than any in decades. The decisions that we have taken to ensure that we have the ships for a modern Navy are being implemented. We are robustly implementing the combination of that investment with a clear strategy for industry, published at the end of 2005. That is leading to industry making the changes that we need to get to the point where this country has a competitive shipbuilding industry that can continue to build the ships that the Navy needs in future. We do not need to begin contemplating what we do about not going ahead with the carriers; we just need to get the deal in place such that we can begin manufacture."
25/06/2007,Lords,10,Lord Pearson of Rannoch,Lords,UKIP,"My Lords, if the ships are eventually built, is it intended that they will form part of the rapid reaction force?"
25/06/2007,Lords,11,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"No, my Lords. The purpose of the ships is to provide the centrepiece of the carrier strike force which was set out in the Strategic Defence Review in 1998. It is a fundamental pillar of the Governmentâs defence strategy."
25/06/2007,Lords,12,Lord Cobbold,Lords,Crossbench,"My Lords, what is the status of negotiations with France on the aircraft carriers?"
25/06/2007,Lords,13,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, we agreed at the end of 2005 to work with France in licensing to it the design rights to the aircraft carriers. As it was able to use our work on its own aircraft carrier, it agreed to pay one-third of the costs through the development phase. That collaboration has gone well. We have been able to maintain the pace and cost of the British project without any negative impacts because of the structure of that collaboration with France."
25/06/2007,Lords,14,Baroness Fookes,Lords,Con,"My Lords, what is the earliest date when we might expect the carriers, assuming that the original date is now completely obsolete?"
25/06/2007,Lords,15,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, it is not obsolete. Do not assume because we have not signed the contracts on the building of the carriers that we are prepared to see any slippage on their implementation and coming into service."
25/06/2007,Lords,16,Lord Wallace of Saltaire,Lords,LD,"My Lords, is the Minister confident that there will be aircraft appropriate to fly off the carriers when they are delivered? I see that at the recent air show there was a cardboard, plywood and papier mÃ¢chÃ© model of the JSF on display. How is the JSF making progress, and are we confident that it will be ready when the aircraft carriers are ready?"
25/06/2007,Lords,17,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, an aircraft carrier without aircraft would be useless. I am pleased that the noble Lord saw a papier mÃ¢chÃ© model. If he was prepared to travel to the United States, he could see the real thing flying. It is going through its test flights very successfully, and it is a very impressive aircraft."
25/06/2007,Lords,18,Lord Swinfen,Lords,Con,"My Lords, have the vessels that were lost to the Iranians from HMS âCornwallâ been replaced? Have replacements even been ordered?"
25/06/2007,Lords,19,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, they have absolutely been replaced. No loss of capability has followed from the loss of those two small boats to the Iranians."
25/06/2007,Lords,20,Earl Attlee,Lords,Con,"My Lords, how is the STOVL version of JSF going?"
25/06/2007,Lords,21,Lord Drayson,"The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence",Lab,"My Lords, it is going really well. The STOVL version has the British technology, and it is the follow-up to the Harrier. It is British technology not only in the lift fan, which powers the short take-off and vertical landing aircraft, but in the technology around the manufacture of the aircraft."
20/02/2012,Commons,1,Nick Smith,Blaenau Gwent,Lab,What recent assessment he has made of the cost of the UK carrier programme.
20/02/2012,Commons,2,Peter Luff,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The overall cost of the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier programme is continually informed by the conversion development phase, which is developing a much greater understanding of the costs and risks involved. We will publish the findings as soon as we can and will keep the House informed in the usual manner."
20/02/2012,Commons,3,Nick Smith,Blaenau Gwent,Lab,"May I press the Minister to say what will be the total project cost after converting the carriers for the carrier variant aircraft? If he cannot tell us and it does not look as though he can does he recognise that that is a worrying, unfunded liability?"
20/02/2012,Commons,4,Peter Luff,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I am afraid that I cannot answer the honourable Gentlemanâs question, because we simply do not know the answer. In answer to the honourable Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck), I talked about the possible price implications for the joint strike fighter as a result of the Americansâ decisions in rescheduling their profile. Similarly, we are still doing the work on the precise cost of the conversion. We will report to the House in the usual way. That will be part of the major projects report, so all the normal processes will be followed. I understand the importance of the honourable Gentlemanâs question."
20/02/2012,Commons,5,Mr Edward Leigh,Gainsborough,Con,"Whatever the cost of the carriers, is not a key argument in their favour that if God forbid the Falklands were, despite all our preparations, taken in a surprise attack, it would be essential to have a carrier to regain them? Does not that prompt the question of why we do not have one at the moment?"
20/02/2012,Commons,6,Peter Luff,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I understand my honourable Friendâs concern, and I am aware of the arguments about, for example, the use of carriers off Libya. However, I think that the correct decisions were taken in the strategic defence and security review regarding the Tornado aircraft, which enabled us to fight that war very effectively. I repeat what my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State said: the Falklands are well protected; we live in a different world; and the suggestion that aircraft carriers play an important part in the Falkland Islands in the near future is unhelpful at this stage."
10/05/2012,Commons,1,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the carrier strike programme. The strategic defence and security review considered the carrier strike programme, put in place by the previous Government, as part of a wide-ranging review of options for delivering effective future defence while dealing with the black hole in Labourâs defence budget and the unaffordable âfantasyâ equipment plan bequeathed to us by the Labour party. While the review confirmed that carrier strike would be a key capability in delivering Future Force 2020, it also recognised the unsustainability as a whole of the defence equipment plan we inherited."
10/05/2012,Commons,2,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The strategic decision on carrier strike that emerged from the SDSR process was to convert one carrier with catapults and arrester gear to operate the carrier variant of the joint strike fighter, facilitating greater interoperability with allies, with a decision on the future use or disposal of the second carrier to be taken at the 2015 SDSR. The decision was also taken routinely to embark 12 fast jets while retaining the ability to surge up to the previously planned level of 36 aircraft. As the House would expect for such a complex and high-value project, the strategic decision taken at SDSR was followed by the commissioning of a detailed programme of work to look at the costs, risks and technical feasibility of all aspects of the proposed solution. That study was expected to take 18 months, completing by the end of 2012."
10/05/2012,Commons,3,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"Since I took on the role of Defence Secretary in October last year, my overriding concern, after current operations and the welfare of our armed forces, has been to ensure the deliverability of the MODâs equipment plan and the achievement of a balanced and sustainable budget. That will give our armed forces the assurance they need to carry out the massive transformation that will deliver Future Force 2020 the concept for our armed forces set out in the SDSR. The carrier project is a large element of the equipment programme, and I have worked closely with the new Chief of Defence MatÃ©riel, Bernard Gray, to assess the technical and financial risks involved in it."
10/05/2012,Commons,4,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"It quickly became clear to me that a number of the underlying facts on which the SDSR decision on carriers was based were changing. First, as the programme to convert a carrier to operate with a catapult system has matured, and more detailed analysis has been carried out by suppliers, it has become clear that operational carrier strike capability, using the âcats and trapsâ system, could not be delivered until late 2023 at the earliest considerably later than the date envisaged at the time of the SDSR of âaround 2020â. Britainâs carriers will have all-electric propulsion, and therefore will not generate steam like nuclear-powered vessels, so the catapult system would need to be the innovative electromagnetic version, EMALS the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System being developed for the United States navy. Fitting that new system to a UK carrier has presented greater design challenges than were anticipated."
10/05/2012,Commons,5,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"Secondly, and partly as a result of the delayed timetable, the estimated cost of fitting this equipment to HMS Prince of Wales has more than doubled in the past 17 months, rising from an estimated  950 million to  about  2 billion, with no guarantee that it will not rise further. Given the technical complexity involved and given that the cost of retrofitting âcats and trapsâ to HMS Queen Elizabeth the first carrier out of build would be even higher, it is unlikely that she would ever, in practice, be converted in the future."
10/05/2012,Commons,6,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"Thirdly, at the time of the SDSR there was judged to be a very significant technical risk around the STOVL short take-off, vertical landing version of the joint strike fighter, and some commentators were speculating that it could even be cancelled. Indeed, the STOVL programme was subsequently placed on probation by the Pentagon However, over the past year, the STOVL programme has made excellent progress and in the past few months has been removed from probation. The aircraft has now completed more than 900 hours of flying, including flights from the USS Wasp, and the US marine corps has a high degree of confidence in the in-service date for the aircraft. The balance of risk has changed, and there is now judged to be no greater risk in STOVL than in other variants of JSF."
10/05/2012,Commons,7,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"Fourthly, further work with our allies on the best approach to collaborative operation has satisfied us that joint maritime task groups involving our carriers, with co-ordinated scheduling of maintenance and refit periods, and an emphasis on carrier availability, rather than cross-deck operations, is the more appropriate route to optimising alliance capabilities."
10/05/2012,Commons,8,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"When the facts change, the responsible thing to do is to examine the decisions you have made and to be willing to change your mind, however inconvenient that may be. It is about doing what is right for Britain, not burying your head in the sand and ploughing on regardless, as the previous Government all too often did. A persistent failure to observe that simple principle is at the root of many of the MOD budget problems that we inherited from the Labour party, and I do not intend to repeat its mistakes."
10/05/2012,Commons,9,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The decision taken in the SDSR to proceed with a carrier strike capability, despite the massive challenges we faced with the MODâs budget, was the right decision. The decision to seek to contain costs by going for âcats and trapsâ on a single carrier, with greater interoperability with allies, and the cheaper carrier variant version of the JSF aircraft was also the right decision, based on the information available at the time. However, the facts have changed, and I am not prepared to accept a delay in regenerating Britainâs carrier strike capability beyond the timetable set out in the SDSR. And I am not prepared to put the equipment plan, which will support Future Force 2020, at risk of a billion-pound-plus increase in the carrier programme and unquantifiable risk of further cost rises."
10/05/2012,Commons,10,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"So, I can announce to the House today that the National Security Council has decided not to proceed with the âcats and trapsâ conversion, but to complete both carriers in the STOVL configuration. That will give us the ability to use both carriers to provide continuous carrier availability, at a net additional operating cost averaging about  60 million per year. As we set out in the SDSR, a final decision on the use of the second carrier will be taken as part of SDSR 2015. We will switch the order for JSF aircraft from CV to STOVL, which we can do without delaying delivery and, by  making this announcement today, we can plan on the basis of the first operational aircraft being delivered with a UK-weapons-fit package."
10/05/2012,Commons,11,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"We expect HMS Queen Elizabeth to be handed over to the Navy in early 2017 for sea trials. We expect to take delivery of our first test aircraft in July of this year, and we expect the first production aircraft to be delivered to us in 2016, with flying from the Queen Elizabeth to begin in 2018, after her sea trials are complete."
10/05/2012,Commons,12,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"We have discussed this decision with the French Government and with the United States. The French confirm that they are satisfied with our commitment to jointly planned carrier operations to enhance European-NATO capability. The United States, on whose support we would rely in regenerating either type of carrier capability, has been highly supportive throughout the review and I would like to record my personal thanks to the Secretary of Defence, the Pentagon, the navy and the marine corps for their high level of engagement with us. I spoke to Secretary Panetta last night and he confirmed the USâs willingness to support our decision and its view that UK carrier strike availability and our commitment to the JSF programme are the key factors. The Chief of the Defence Staff and his fellow chiefs of staff all of them endorse this decision as the quickest and most assured way now to deliver carrier strike as part of an overall affordable equipment programme that will support Future Force 2020."
10/05/2012,Commons,13,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"This was not an easy decision to take, but our responsibility is to make the right decision on the basis of the facts available to us. Neither I nor any of my colleagues came into government expecting decisions to be easy or pain-free. I have a responsibility to clear up the financial mess we inherited in the MOD, just as we are clearing up the mess we inherited across Government as a whole, and to set a balanced budget and an affordable, deliverable equipment programme with manageable and bounded risk. This decision addresses one of the last impediments to my announcing the achievement of those objectives to the House, and I hope to be able to do so very soon."
10/05/2012,Commons,14,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"This is not just about balancing budgets, critical as that is. It is about the UKâs defence, secured by an appropriate and sustainable military capability. This announcement delivers an affordable solution to securing that capability and, with two useable carriers, gives us the option of continuous carrier availability. It confirms the expected delivery of the first test aircraft this summer, of the first production aircraft in 2016, of the first carrier into sea trials in 2017 and of the first flight of the JSF from the deck of the carrier in 2018, with an operational military capability in 2020. It confirms the support of our principal allies, the US and France, and that of the defence chiefs. It shows that we, at least, are not afraid to take difficult decisions when they are right for Britain and I commend the statement to the House."
10/05/2012,Commons,15,Mr Jim Murphy,East Renfrewshire,Lab,"I thank the Secretary of State for his statement. Let me start by saying again that when the Government do the right thing on defence they will have the support of Labour Members. In politics, however, one can often judge what a Government genuinely feel about their own policy not just by what they say but by when they say it.  They have told the media that this is positive news and yet they announced it here in the Commons the very first day after the council election defeats. It must be the first ever example of a Government waiting until the polls close to announce good news."
10/05/2012,Commons,16,Mr Jim Murphy,East Renfrewshire,Lab,"It is worth reminding the Secretary of State how he got here. The Government were elected promising a bigger Army but are delivering the smallest Army since the Boer war, they have curtailed anti-piracy duties owing to Royal Navy cuts and the RAF has lost long-term surveillance capabilities. On the defence budget, decisions this Government have taken have increased costs. Changes to the Astute class submarines added a further  200 million and the carrier U-turn has cost up to  250 million. On top of that, they are failing on reform with the defence procurement plan delayed for two years. Last year, the largest defence programmes were delayed by a combined 30 months adding  500 million to their costs and while hundreds of defence workers across the country are losing their jobs the Government have no defence industrial strategy to speak of whatsoever."
10/05/2012,Commons,17,Mr Jim Murphy,East Renfrewshire,Lab,"The biggest blow to the Governmentâs defence credibility is this chaotic carrier programme. Standing at the Dispatch Box, the Prime Minister announced his plans to U-turn on Labourâs carrier strike policy, scrap the Harriers, sell Ark Royal, build two carriers but mothball one, sack trainee pilots and downgrade British sea power. But that U-turn has now come full circle. Nothing has been gained and two years have been wasted. In tough times,  250 million have been squandered while the forces are having their allowances cut. Harriers are being sold to the Americans for a fraction of their value, we are subject to international ridicule and there will be no jets on carriers for a decade. Mr Speaker, you do not have to be a military strategist to know what aircraft carriers are meant to carry the clue is in the name."
10/05/2012,Commons,18,Mr Jim Murphy,East Renfrewshire,Lab,"The Government say their policy is cheaper, but it is more expensive. They said there would be interoperability with the French but their chosen jet cannot land on the French carrier. The Prime Minister personally derided a policy that he is now defending. The Government said that Britain did not need jump jets and Ministers scrapped the expertise needed to operate STOVL aircraft only now to decide to buy a new fleet of jump jets. We now need to retrain people and redevelop the skills that were so carelessly cast aside just two years ago. That is as incoherent as it is ludicrous."
10/05/2012,Commons,19,Mr Jim Murphy,East Renfrewshire,Lab,"The Secretary of Stateâs defence today is that the facts have changed, but that is not the full story. I know the advice that the Prime Minister received that the defence review policy was high risk and high cost but the Prime Minister overruled that. The Public Accounts Committee warned of rising costs, the National Audit Office said that the Government had an âimmature understandingâ of the costs, and the Select Committee on Defence warned against strategic shrinkage. The Prime Ministerâs decisions have cost British time, British money, British talent and British prestige."
10/05/2012,Commons,20,Mr Jim Murphy,East Renfrewshire,Lab,"I know the Secretary of State always likes to blame someone else, and he has done that again today. He recently accused British families of causing the financial crash, but he cannot scapegoat the former Defence Secretary for this decision. He has to take some responsibility for the Prime Ministerâs mistakes. The Secretary of State has carefully nurtured a reputation as a spreadsheet king who is most at home over his paperwork,  so he needs to share some of it with us today. Will he publish a full breakdown of the costs of the plans being abandoned? Will he confirm that the cost of the U-turn is greater than the income from the sale of the Harrier jump jets? How many of the new aircraft does he plan to purchase? Will he confirm that Ministers were warned 18 months ago about the risks and costs inherent in this decision? If Britain will have two aircraft carriers, will the Royal Navy have to increase the number of its personnel? Finally, there is another question that the Secretary of State did not cover in his statement: what will now be the total cost of the carrier build programme?"
10/05/2012,Commons,21,Mr Jim Murphy,East Renfrewshire,Lab,"In conclusion, the Secretary of State has said the Government will do the right thing when the facts have changed, but the previous Labour Government got things right whereas this Governmentâs policy has unravelled. In recent weeks we have seen incompetence piled upon political hubris. Only a Government who started a petrol crisis when trying to avoid one and whose idea of putting more police on the streets is having thousands demonstrating outside Parliament would have a policy of building two carriers, mothballing one immediately, selling the Harriers and having no planes to fly off aircraft carriers for a decade. Describing the Governmentâs defence strategy as an âomnishamblesâ would be a compliment. It is time the Prime Minister started to take responsibility. He should be at the Dispatch Box apologising for his and his Governmentâs incompetence."
10/05/2012,Commons,22,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"Before the right honourable Gentleman climbs too far up his high horse, perhaps we should, to give a bit of context, remind ourselves of the role that his party played in the history of this project. It was Labourâs fiscal incontinence that created the black hole that we are trying to climb out of and Labourâs decisions that left us facing the challenges we faced at the time of the strategic defence and security review. It was Labour that ordered two 65,000 tonnes carriers, three times the size of a typical STOVL carrier, without cats and traps."
10/05/2012,Commons,23,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"It was Labour who let the contracts on a sweetheart deal, which meant that cancelling the second carrier would have cost more than going ahead and building it. It was Labour who ordered the ships without having the money to pay for them, and then drove costs of  1.6 billion into the carrier programme by delaying the build to accommodate a  250 million cash-flow problem a performance described by the Public Accounts Committee as setting"
10/05/2012,Commons,24,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,âa new benchmark in poor corporate decision making.â
10/05/2012,Commons,25,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"Let me turn to the couple of specific questions buried at the end of the shadow Defence Secretaryâs rant. He asked me about the timing of the statement. I have come to the House at the earliest possible date after the National Security Council took the decision to make the change. He said that  250 million has been squandered. I tell the House frankly that expenditure has been incurred in appraising the option of building a CV carrier and fitting it with cats and traps, but it has been nowhere near the  250 million that the right honourable Gentleman referred to. He asked me if I would publish details of the costs involved."
10/05/2012,Commons,26,Mr Jim Murphy,East Renfrewshire,Lab,You donât know.
10/05/2012,Commons,27,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The right honourable Gentleman says that I do not know. If he had ever been a Defence Minister, or inside the Ministry of Defence, he would understand  why I do not know. These are complex contracts. I can give him an approximate idea. We think the cost of the design work that has been carried out and the appraisal work will be between  40 million and  50 million. There may also be some exit costs payable to the US contractors responsible for the EMAL system. We will be negotiating around those issues, and I give the right honourable Gentleman this commitment: once we have a definitive figure, I will make it available to the House."
10/05/2012,Commons,28,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The right honourable Gentleman said that we will have no jets on our carriers for a decade. I do not think he was listening to the statement. We will take delivery of the first test aircraft this year. We will receive the first STOVL variant aircraft in 2016 for operation off land. The carrier will go into sea trials in 2017 and, as soon as she has completed them in 2018, flights will begin from the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth. It will take us two years to work up full military operational capability, but it is important that the honourable Member for North Durham (Mr Jones), who is shaking his head, understands what that means. It is the gap between getting from the point when we fly the jets off the carrier to the point when the military are satisfied that we have full operational capability."
10/05/2012,Commons,29,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The right honourable Gentleman asked about the number of aircraft that we will be purchasing. The plans for deployment of aircraft have not changed as a result of this announcement. We will routinely embark 12 aircraft and we will be able to surge that number to 36. On the purchasing of aircraft in the joint strike fighter programme, I can tell him that there is no requirement for us to go firm with numbers at this early stage of the programme. Where we can retain optionality, we will do so, as part of prudent budget management."
10/05/2012,Commons,30,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The right honourable Gentleman asked about risks and costs in this project and in the carrier variant project. We are talking about a project with a total cost of around  10 billion. It is hugely complex, probably the second largest industrial project under way in this country today. There will always be risks, and there will always be risks of cost escalation in such a project. The challenge is not to eliminate risks, but to manage them. That is what proper management of the Ministry of Defence is all about."
10/05/2012,Commons,31,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The right honourable Gentleman asked about the operation of two carriers. If at the next strategic defence and security review, the Government and the National Security Council take the decision to operate two carriers in order to give us continuous carrier availability, there will be an additional cost of about  60 million a year on average for additional crewing and maintenance to keep the two carriers in high readiness."
10/05/2012,Commons,32,Dr Liam Fox,North Somerset,Con,"Will the Secretary of State accept that there were two optimal mixes for JSF and carrier? We could either have a 65,000 tonne carrier and use the carrier variant, with a longer range and bigger payload, or, as the American marine corps are doing, choose the jump jet variant and have smaller carriers. Is the position we are in today sub-optimal, and not the result of industrial policy leading military policy? Does he accept that the real difference, and the reason why he has come to this decision, is that the  extra time required for the EMAL system to be put in actually breaches the risk that we were willing to take at the SDSR?"
10/05/2012,Commons,33,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"My right honourable Friend is absolutely right that at the SDSR, a view was taken about the amount of risk that was tolerable, about the horizon to which we could accept an absence of carrier capability and, as I have said, I am certainly not prepared to see us go beyond 2020 without the carrier strike capability."
10/05/2012,Commons,34,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"My right honourable Friend is absolutely right. This is the question for Opposition Members to answer: why did they order two 65,000 tonne carriers without cats and traps, which anyone involved in naval aviation operations knows is itself an absurdity? [Interruption.]"
10/05/2012,Commons,35,Mr Speaker,NA,NA,"Order. I appeal to the House to calm down. The honourable Member for North Durham (Mr Jones), assisted by his colleagues, is chuntering repetitively from a sedentary position, in breach of the conventions of the House. I ask the honourable Gentleman to exercise what modicum of self-restraint he is able, in the circumstances, to muster."
10/05/2012,Commons,36,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"We inherited this programme, and frankly I am not interested in trading insults with the Opposition about what happened in the past. What I need to do now is take the carriers that are in build and that are being built under a contract that makes it more expensive to cancel them than to complete them, and put them to the best possible military use for the defence of this country."
10/05/2012,Commons,37,Mr Bob Ainsworth,Coventry North East,Lab,"The Secretary of State has taken, and is announcing, the right decision today, and I understand how difficult it is to perform that kind of U-turn and how uncomfortable it must be. But I cannot go along with him on the excuse the reason that both he and the Prime Minister decided to give for that decision. That is that the facts have changed and therefore we are changing the decision."
10/05/2012,Commons,38,Mr Bob Ainsworth,Coventry North East,Lab,"I reviewed this decision, taken by my predecessors. The fundamental facts were there at the time and have not changed. We have been up an extremely expensive cul-de-sac for the last 18 months as a result of a shambles of an SDSR, and I can only congratulate the Secretary of State on bringing some sanity to it; but he ought to understand the problem that he will give himself in sorting out procurement work which, yes, is problematic and was in our time if he cannot find a way of being straight about why the decision is being taken and the fact that the previous decision was taken in the face of clear advice to the contrary."
10/05/2012,Commons,39,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I refute that last comment absolutely. The right honourable Gentleman is in a better position than many in the House to understand the complexities and the challenges of defence procurement, but to say that the facts have not changed is simply wrong. The risk profile of the STOVL aircraft is dramatically different now from what it was in 2010, when there was a very real risk that the variant would be cancelled. The cost estimates for fitting the EMAL system, and the understanding of the complexity of that task, have matured through the work that we have done since the SDSR. Although I am grateful for the right honourable Gentlemanâs endorsement of the substantive decision, he is simply wrong when he says the facts have not changed."
10/05/2012,Commons,40,Mr James Arbuthnot,North East Hampshire,Con,"To make an announcement like this takes real courage and I commend the Secretary of State, and the Prime Minister, for making what I agree with the former Secretary of State is the right decision. Is my right honourable Friend able to say how much it would have cost to have converted the second carrier to cats and traps, because was there not a real risk that we would end up with a carrier that we could neither use nor sell?"
10/05/2012,Commons,41,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"My right honourable Friend is correct to focus on that point, and I thank him for his comments. As I think I said in my statement, fitting cats and traps retrospectively to the Queen Elizabeth, after her completion, would undoubtedly be significantly more expensive than even the current  2 billion estimate for fitting them to the Prince of Wales in build. It is therefore not unreasonable to think of a likely cost of between  2.5 billion and  3 billion for retrospective fit to the Queen Elizabeth, making that project, as I suggested in my statement, in practice unlikely ever to occur."
10/05/2012,Commons,42,Stewart Hosie,Dundee East,SNP,"Can the Secretary of State confirm that the terms of business agreement signed in 2009 provide that on completion of the carrier build, the UK will be spending perhaps only  230 million a year 0.7% of the MOD budget to maintain essential shipbuilding skills? More important, will he tell us whether, as a result of the additional costs announced in todayâs statement, he envisages that very small figure being reduced further in the future?"
10/05/2012,Commons,43,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The honourable Gentleman is absolutely right: the terms of business agreement with the shipbuilding consortium commits the MOD to underwriting overhead costs of about  230 million a year to maintain skills. The challenge for the MOD is so to manage the shipbuilding programme as to recover as much of that as possible. After the carrier programme is finished in the shipyards covered by the TOBA, we will move on to the Type 26 programme and recover costs in that way. As far as I am aware, there is no mechanism for reducing that  230 million it is a contractual figure."
10/05/2012,Commons,44,Sir Menzies Campbell,North East Fife,LD,"Is it not abundantly clear that any discomfort or embarrassment the Government may feel is more than outweighed by the fact that the decision the Secretary of State has announced today is right both tactically and strategically? When the sound and fury have died down, that is what will concern those members of the Royal Navy who have the responsibility of looking after these ships and the aircraft that fly from them. Is it not important that todayâs announcement will help to close earlier the yawning gap in capability left by the decommissioning of the Harrier aircraft and the carriers from which they were deployed? That shows commendable flexibility on the part of the right honourable Gentleman. I hope he will show the same flexibility in respect of other matters, not least, for example, the role of the Royal Air Force at Leuchars in my constituency."
10/05/2012,Commons,45,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I knew my right honourable and learned Friend would get that in somewhere, but I thank him for his question. In the interest of tri-service harmony, I should make it clear that responsibility for the aircraft will be a combined responsibility of the Royal Navy and the RAF."
10/05/2012,Commons,46,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"My right honourable and learned Friend refers to the Harrier question. Perhaps I need to remind him that it was the previous Government who sealed the fate of the Harrier in 2006, when they scrapped the Navyâs FA2 Sea Harriers, leaving only the ground attack version; and then in 2009 cut the size of that fleet, so that by the time of the SDSR in 2010 the fleet was simply too small to sustain operations in Afghanistan, never mind in Libya as well. We therefore had to take the difficult decision to end the Harrierâs service with the Royal Navy in order to sustain the Tornado, which continues to serve in Afghanistan and which acquitted itself so well in Libya."
10/05/2012,Commons,47,Derek Twigg,Halton,Lab,"I agree that the Secretary of State has made the right decision, particularly given the current financial climate, but I want him to clarify a comment he made. He said that the option of cancelling the carrier programme was not open to him. If it had been open to him, would he have cancelled it?"
10/05/2012,Commons,48,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The SDSR in 2010 considered the possibility of cancelling the second carrier, to deal with the huge budget challenges we inherited, but the terms of business agreement was such that cancelling the carrier at that point would have cost more than delivering it."
10/05/2012,Commons,49,Penny Mordaunt,Portsmouth North,Con,"I have long argued that if we are going to spend money on carrier strike force, we need to ensure that we have that capability all year round. Can the Secretary of State confirm that, in terms of capability, one advantage of the programme he has announced today is that it puts two operational carriers back on the table?"
10/05/2012,Commons,50,Ms Gisela Stuart,"Birmingham, Edgbaston",Lab,"I am still trying to understand precisely what the new facts are that the Secretary of State so recently discovered. He mentions risk profiles and cost estimates, but surely they were known. Would it not be wise of him either to be more specific or, even better, to publish the advice that would show us what those new facts are?"
10/05/2012,Commons,51,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The honourable Lady will remember that I spent three and a half years in a shadow Treasury brief, during which time I developed a healthily jaundiced view of the Ministry of Defenceâs procurement process. Now that I am inside the Department and see the process from the other side, I understand that it is a little bit more complicated than nipping down to the local supermarket to buy a carton of eggs or a bottle of  milk. These are immensely complex projects. The way they typically work is that they start with a high-level estimate, informed by the best information available. One then commits funds this costs money to do a more detailed appraisal that identifies the technical and financial challenges and risks around the project. That is precisely what we have done. In terms of the appropriate management of a large, complex project, the MOD has followed exactly the right process. It has delivered us the facts to which I referred, and we have drawn the appropriate conclusions from them."
10/05/2012,Commons,52,Mr Tobias Ellwood,Bournemouth East,Con,"The Opposition should show a little more humility and gloat less on the subject of their responsibility towards the Royal Navy. It was Labour that quibbled over the design for 10 years, and Labour that told the workers to down tools, which cost  1.6 billion. It was Labour that sacked the Sea Harrier and indeed the Ark Royal and Labour that cut the number of Type 45s from 12 to six. That is the maritime legacy that this Government have inherited."
10/05/2012,Commons,53,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,I agree.
10/05/2012,Commons,54,Mr Speaker,NA,NA,"We can leave it at that. I am grateful to the honourable Member for Bournemouth East, but in future, a question mark would be appreciated."
10/05/2012,Commons,55,Nick Smith,Blaenau Gwent,Lab,Will the Secretary of State confirm if he has investigated whether Mr Adam Werritty met any companies or lobbyists involved in the original very bad decision?
10/05/2012,Commons,56,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I have answered a number of parliamentary questions on the information that the Department holds on meetings held by, and contacts made with, Mr Werritty. As far as I am aware, I have disclosed in parliamentary questions the full extent of the Departmentâs knowledge."
10/05/2012,Commons,57,Oliver Colvile,"Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport",Con,"Amphibious capability is a key part of our defence strategy. I thank my right honourable Friend for making sure that we clarify the timetable, but will he explain what impact the decision will have on amphibious capability, so that we can ensure that our Royal Marines are protected when they go on to land?"
10/05/2012,Commons,58,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The STOVL configuration of the carrier in the carrier-enabled power projection model means that the carrier will embark both fast jets and helicopters Chinook, Lynx and Merlin. It will also be able to embark Marines. It is a very large ship, as we have mentioned this morning. It will have the capability to carry troops and embark helicopters and fast jets in a way that will facilitate amphibious warfare."
10/05/2012,Commons,59,Thomas Docherty,Dunfermline and West Fife,Lab,"Even a first-week midshipman could tell the Prime Minister that adopting two 180Â° U-turns takes us back to where we started two years ago. Will the Secretary of State give a commitment that the Government will continue to stand beside the use of Rosyth dockyard for the long-term maintenance of the carriers when they  enter service? Will he tell the House what we will achieve, except squandering he knows not how many millions of pounds, by flogging our Harrier fleet for spare parts for a peppercorn, scrapping a generation of fast-jet Harrier pilots, and leaving the nation with "
10/05/2012,Commons,60,Mr Speaker,NA,NA,We have got the gist. I am most grateful to the honourable Gentleman.
10/05/2012,Commons,61,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"A first-week midshipman could probably tell the honourable Gentleman that it is not normal to order a 65,000 tonne STOVL carrier without any cats and traps. With regard to the honourable Gentlemanâs question on Rosyth, no decision has been taken on where the carriers will be maintained in future."
10/05/2012,Commons,62,John Glen,Salisbury,Con,"It is widely alleged by some that the through-life costs of the F-35B could compare unfavourably with those of the F-35C. What rigorous assessment has my right honourable Friend undertaken to ensure that we achieve value for money, having made this decision, and what wider lessons on the defence budget can be drawn for similarly important and large decisions in future?"
10/05/2012,Commons,63,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"To answer the last question first, I am drawing some very interesting conclusions about how to manage the defence budget on an ongoing basis and hope to share them with the House shortly. It is precisely because the F-35C variant, on the face of it, has a lower purchase cost and a lower through-life maintenance cost that this option was pursued at the time of the SDSR 2010, but operating the carrier variant will of course require the installation upfront of the catapults and arrester gears, which we now know will cost in the order of  2 billion and rising. On the basis of a properly discounted cash-flow analysis over 30 years, I am clear that the STOVL variant, given the current estimate of the cost of cats and traps, will now be cheaper."
10/05/2012,Commons,64,Jason McCartney,Colne Valley,Con,"At the Royal Air Force officer training college at Cranwell we were taught that flexibility is the key to air power. I congratulate my right honourable Friend on showing the flexibility to make the right decision for our nation and our future military capability. Will he confirm that his decision has the support of the Chiefs, unlike the previous Governmentâs decision to scrap the Sea Harriers, which reportedly led to two of the Chiefs standing down?"
10/05/2012,Commons,65,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I am very clear that my job is about supporting the military and our armed forces in defending our country. When I make decisions, I will work with the Chiefs to reach an outcome that works for the military. I can confirm that the Chief of the Defence Staff and all three single service Chiefs support the decision and have confirmed their support in writing to the Prime Minister."
10/05/2012,Commons,66,Mark Lancaster,Milton Keynes North,Con,"Those on the Labour Front Bench have short memories. The pages of Hansard will show the debate that the honourable Member for North Durham (Mr Jones) and I had in 2009 on the previous Governmentâs decision to withdraw the Harrier from Afghanistan prematurely so that it could be subjected to the programme review the following year and potentially cut. Of course, that is now ancient  history and they seem to have forgotten it. I commend my right honourable Friend for his brave decision, which is undoubtedly the right one, to minimise the capability gap for carrier strike. Will he confirm that the STOVL version is easily a superior aircraft to the Harrier it replaces and equally comparable to anything it might meet in the air?"
10/05/2012,Commons,67,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I am grateful to my honourable Friend for raising a point that perhaps I should have made before. The STOVL variant indeed, any variant of the JSF is a fifth-generation aircraft and represents a step change in capability. It is a stealth aircraft with an autonomous intelligence-gathering capability, and the STOVL variant has significantly greater range than the Harrier had. It is an aircraft with greater capability, greater range than the Harrier and a range of capabilities that previous generations of aircraft simply did not have."
10/05/2012,Commons,68,Andrea Leadsom,South Northamptonshire,Con,"I have received a good deal of correspondence from constituents, both those serving in and those retired from the armed forces, who for a long time have expressed huge concern about the strategy and direction of our procurement. They will be relieved and delighted to hear today that my right honourable Friend has been able to continue to assess the strategy and come up with the right decision and brave enough to announce it to the House. Will he reassure the House that he will never let the woolly thinking and loose purse strings shown by the previous Government undermine our armed forces again?"
10/05/2012,Commons,69,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"My honourable Friend makes an important point. Fiscal incontinence undermines the support that we can offer our armed forces. Doing this in a disciplined way is not, as the right honourable Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr Murphy) would try to present it in a rather sneering fashion, some sort of obsession with spreadsheets; it is about doing our job as politicians, which is to ensure that the support for our armed forces is there, is sustainable and can actually be delivered to them."
10/05/2012,Commons,70,Alun Cairns,Vale of Glamorgan,Con,"The Ministry of Defence has a long and tawdry history of overspend in procurement, timelines that are well in excess of those originally planned and of ploughing on regardless. Will the Secretary of State confirm that his decision today demonstrates a change of culture that really shows that we are getting to grips with the budget and the timelines to provide guarantees to the armed forces and our nation?"
10/05/2012,Commons,71,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I thank my honourable Friend for his question and assure him that we will take the decisions that need to be taken in the interests of the nationâs defence, however awkward or inconvenient. I will come to the House however many times I need to and make however many announcements I need to make to get the Department back on track. I want the MOD to stand tall among the Departments of State, with a normal relationship with the Treasury and with the centre of government, and with proper contingency arrangements in its budget so that the armed forces can be confident that the promises that are made to them will be delivered, unlike those of the previous Government."
10/05/2012,Commons,72,Andrew Bridgen,North West Leicestershire,Con,"What steps is my right honourable Friend taking on defence procurement to ensure that the Government do not risk repeating the mistakes of the previous Government, who even in their last financial year in office, 2009-10, oversaw a huge increase of  3.3 billion in the cost of the 15 largest defence projects?"
10/05/2012,Commons,73,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I think that the announcement I have made today demonstrates for my honourable Friend and the House that we will put prudent management of defence projects ahead of playing politics. It would have been easy to avoid making this decision today, and politically much less uncomfortable, but this is about making the right decisions for the future of our armed forces and I can assure him that that is what we will continue to do."
10/05/2012,Lords,1,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, first, I am sure that the whole House will wish to join me in offering sincere condolences to the families and friends of Guardsman Michael Roland of the 1st Battalion, the Grenadier Guards; Corporal Andrew Roberts of 23 Pioneer Regiment, the Royal Logistic Corps; and Private Ratu Silibaravi of 23 Pioneer Regiment, the Royal Logistic Corps, who were killed on operations in Afghanistan recently. My thoughts are also with the wounded and I pay tribute to the courage and fortitude in which they face their rehabilitation."
10/05/2012,Lords,2,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"The Statement is as follows: âWith permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the carrier strike programme."
10/05/2012,Lords,3,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"The strategic defence and security review considered the carrier strike programme, put in place by the previous Government, as part of a wide-ranging review of options for delivering effective future defence while dealing with the black hole in Labourâs defence budget and the unaffordable âfantasyâ equipment plan bequeathed to us by the party opposite. While the review confirmed that carrier strike would be a key capability in delivering Future Force 2020, it also recognised the unsustainability as a whole of the defence equipment plan we inherited."
10/05/2012,Lords,4,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"The strategic decision on carrier strike which emerged from the SDSR process was to convert one carrier with catapults and arrestor gear to operate the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, facilitating greater interoperability with allies, with a decision on the future use or disposal of the second carrier to be taken at the 2015 SDSR. The decision was also taken routinely to embark 12 fast jets while retaining the ability to surge up to the previously planned level of 36 aircraft. As the House would expect for such a complex and high-value project, the strategic decision taken at SDSR was followed by the commissioning of a detailed programme of work to look at the costs, risks and technical feasibility of all aspects of the proposed solution. That study was expected to take 18 months, completing by the end of 2012."
10/05/2012,Lords,5,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"Since I took on the role of Defence Secretary in October last year, my overriding concern, after current operations and the welfare of our Armed Forces, has been to ensure the deliverability of the MoDâs equipment plan and the achievement of a balanced and sustainable budget. That will give our Armed Forces the assurance they need to carry out the massive transformation that will deliver Future Force 2020 the concept for our Armed Forces set out in the SDSR. The carrier project is a large element of the equipment programme and I have worked closely with the new Chief of Defence Materiel, Bernard Gray, to assess the technical and financial risks involved in it."
10/05/2012,Lords,6,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,It quickly became clear to me that a number of the underlying facts on which the SDSR decision on carriers was based were changing.
10/05/2012,Lords,7,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"First, as the programme to convert a carrier to operate with a catapult system has matured, and more detailed analysis has been carried out by suppliers, it  has become clear that operational carrier strike capability, using the âcats and trapsâ system, could not be delivered until late 2023 at the earliest, considerably later than the date envisaged at the time of the SDSR of âaround 2020â. Because Britainâs carriers will have all-electric propulsion, and therefore do not generate steam like nuclear-powered vessels, the catapult system would need to be the innovative electromagnetic version being developed for the US Navy. Fitting this new system to a UK carrier has presented greater design challenges than were anticipated."
10/05/2012,Lords,8,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"Secondly, and partly as a result of the delayed timetable, the estimated cost of fitting this equipment to the âPrince of Walesâ has more than doubled in the last 17 months, rising from  950 million to around  2 billion, with no guarantee that it will not rise further. Technical complexity and the cost of retrofitting âcats and trapsâ to the âQueen Elizabethâ would be even higher, making it unlikely that it would ever, in practice, be converted in the future."
10/05/2012,Lords,9,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"Thirdly, at the time of the SDSR, there was judged to be a very significant technical risk around the STOVL version of the JSF and some commentators were speculating that it could even be cancelled. Indeed, the STOVL programme was subsequently placed on probation by the Pentagon. However, over the last year, the STOVL programme has made excellent progress and in the last few months has been removed from probation. The aircraft has completed over 900 hours of flying, including flights from the USS âWaspâ, and the US Marine Corps has a high degree of confidence in the in-service date for the aircraft. The balance of risk has changed and there is now judged to be no greater risk in STOVL than in other variants of JSF."
10/05/2012,Lords,10,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"Fourthly, further work with our allies on the best approach to collaborative operation has satisfied us that joint maritime task groups involving our carriers, with co-ordinated scheduling of maintenance and refit periods, and an emphasis on carrier availability rather than cross-deck operations, is the more appropriate route to optimising alliance capabilities."
10/05/2012,Lords,11,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"When the facts change, the responsible thing to do is to examine the decisions you have made and to be willing to change your mind, however inconvenient that may be; doing what is right for Britain, not burying your head in the sand and ploughing on regardless, as the last Government so often did. A persistent failure to observe this simple principle is at the root of many of the MoD budget problems that we inherited from the party opposite. I do not intend to repeat its mistakes. The decision taken in the SDSR to proceed with a carrier strike capability, despite the massive challenges we faced with the MoDâs budget, was the right decision. The decision to seek to contain costs by going for âcats and trapsâ on a single carrier with greater interoperability with allies, and the cheaper CV version of the JSF aircraft, was also the right decision based on the information available at the time."
10/05/2012,Lords,12,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"But the facts have changed. I am not prepared to accept a delay in regenerating Britainâs carrier strike capability beyond the timetable set out in the SDSR, and I am not prepared to put the equipment plan which will support Future Force 2020 at risk of a  billion pound-plus increase in the carrier programme and an unquantifiable risk of further cost rises. So I can announce today that the National Security Council has agreed not to proceed with the âcats and trapsâ conversion, but to complete both carriers in STOVL configuration. This will give us the ability to use both carriers to provide continuous carrier availability at a net additional operating cost averaging about  60 million per year. As we set out in the SDSR, a final decision on the use of the second carrier will be taken as part of SDSR 2015."
10/05/2012,Lords,13,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"We will switch the order for JSF aircraft from CV to STOVL, which we can do without delaying delivery, and by making this announcement today we can plan on the basis of the first operational aircraft being delivered with a UK weapons-fit package. We expect HMS âQueen Elizabethâ to be handed over to the Royal Navy in early 2017 for sea trials. We expect to take delivery of our first test aircraft in July of this year, and we expect the first production aircraft to be delivered to us in 2016, with flying from the âQueen Elizabethâ to begin in 2018 after its sea trials are complete."
10/05/2012,Lords,14,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"We have discussed this decision with the French Government and with the United States. The French confirm that they are satisfied with our commitment to jointly planned carrier operations to enhance European-NATO capability. The United States, on whose support we would rely in regenerating either type of carrier capability, has been highly supportive throughout this review, and I would like to record my personal thanks to the Secretary of Defence, the Pentagon, the Navy and the Marine Corps for their high level of engagement with us. I spoke to Secretary Panetta last night and he confirmed the USâs willingness to support our decision and its view that UK carrier strike availability and our commitment to the JSF programme are the key factors. The Chief of the Defence Staff and his fellow chiefs of staff all of them endorse this decision as the quickest and most assured way now to deliver carrier strike as part of an overall affordable equipment programme that will support Future Force 2020."
10/05/2012,Lords,15,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"This was not an easy decision to take, but our responsibility is to make the right decision on the basis of the facts available to us. Neither I nor any of my colleagues came into government expecting decisions to be easy or pain-free. I have a responsibility to clear up the financial mess we inherited in the MoD, just as we are clearing up the mess we inherited across government as a whole: to set a balanced budget and an affordable, deliverable equipment programme with manageable and bounded risk. This decision addresses one of the last impediments to me announcing the achievement of those objectives to the House, and I hope to be able to do so very soon."
10/05/2012,Lords,16,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"But it is not just about balancing budgets, critical as that is. It is about the UKâs defence, secured by having an appropriate and sustainable military capability. This announcement delivers an affordable solution to securing that capability and, with two useable carriers, gives us the option of continuous carrier availability. It confirms the expected delivery of the first test aircraft this summer; of the first production aircraft in 2016; of the first carrier into sea trials in 2017; and of the first flight of the JSF from the deck of the carrier in 2018, with an operational military capability in 2020.  It confirms the support of our principal allies, the United States and France, and that of the defence chiefs. It shows that we, at least, are not afraid to take difficult decisions when they are right for Britain. I commend this Statement to the Houseâ."
10/05/2012,Lords,17,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"First, I extend our sincere condolences to the families and friends of the three members of our Armed Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf in the service of our country."
10/05/2012,Lords,18,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"I thank the noble Lord for repeating the Statement made by the Secretary of State in the other place. Yesterday we had the Queenâs Speech, which contained no direct reference to our Armed Forces or to defence. Today we have found out why. Defence policy is today an embarrassment for a Government who acted in haste when they came into office and were more interested in trying to score points than in embarking on a measured and considered strategic defence and security review with time for full and appropriate consultation before final conclusions and decisions were reached. They are a Government who were more interested in making unsubstantiated claims about an alleged  38 billion unfunded liability over the next 10 years, and judging by the Statement just repeated by the noble Lord, the Governmentâs approach has not changed on that score. They have withheld information from the Commons Defence Select Committee as to how that figure was calculated, and the National Audit Office figures did not support their claim either."
10/05/2012,Lords,19,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"A key reason why money is now in short supply is because the growth in the economy which this Government inherited had been thrown away by them six months after they took office, has never been restored, and we are now in a double dip recession. The rushed strategic defence and security review made no real reference to north Africa, yet a few months later our forces were involved in action in the Mediterranean off the Libyan coast. In their foreword to the strategic defence and security review, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister had declared, as they decommissioned HMS âArk Royalâ and sold off the Harriers at a knock-down price, that:"
10/05/2012,Lords,20,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"âIn the short term, there are few circumstances we can envisage where the ability to deploy airpower from the sea will be essentialâ."
10/05/2012,Lords,21,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"Fortunately, that view was not shared by those nations which did have an operational aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister went on to assert that the previous Government,"
10/05/2012,Lords,22,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,âcommitted to carriers that would have been unable to work properly with our closest military alliesâ.
10/05/2012,Lords,23,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"They said that they would ârectify this errorâ by fitting,"
10/05/2012,Lords,24,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,âa catapult to the operational carrier to enable it to fly a version of the Joint Strike Fighter with a longer range and able to carry more weaponsâ.
10/05/2012,Lords,25,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"Indeed, the Prime Minister asserted that the previous Government had got it âbadly wrongâ. The Governmentâs rushed strategic defence and security review then told us:"
10/05/2012,Lords,26,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"âInstalling the catapult and arrestor will allow the UK to acquire the carrier-variant of Joint Strike Fighter ready to deploy on the converted carrier instead of the short take-off and vertical  landing (STOVL) variant. This version of the jet has a longer range and greater payload: this, not large numbers of aircraft, is the critical requirement for precision strike operations in the futureâ."
10/05/2012,Lords,27,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"Do those words I have just quoted from the SDSR now represent government policy or not in the light of the Statement the Minister has just repeated, which says that the Government will switch the order for JSF aircraft from carrier-variant to STOVL? In view of the penultimate sentence in the foreword to the SDSR by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, which says:"
10/05/2012,Lords,28,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"âWe must never send our soldiers, sailors and airmen into battle without the right equipmentâ,"
10/05/2012,Lords,29,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,has the Prime Minister now changed his view? Does he now accept that the STOVL-variant rather than the carrier-variant of the JSF is the âright equipmentâ for our forces?
10/05/2012,Lords,30,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"The Prime Minister has now come to the conclusion that the previous Governmentâs policy is right. However, the Statement repeated by the Minister seeks to hide behind a claim that the facts have changed. Apparently it has now been found out that the âcats and trapsâ system cannot be delivered until late 2023 at the earliest. Partly as a result of the delayed timetable, the estimated cost of fitting this equipment to the âPrince of Walesâ has apparently more than doubled in the last 17 months, and the cost of fitting cats and traps to the âQueen Elizabethâ would be even higher. Perhaps a little more time spent on undertaking the strategic defence and security review and consulting more widely would have drawn attention to these problems of timescale and cost that the Government say have caused them to rethink their approach."
10/05/2012,Lords,31,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"The Government had clearly decided that there was no likelihood of a problem with cost and timescale, because the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister said in their foreword to the SDSR:"
10/05/2012,Lords,32,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,âWe will fit a catapult to the operational carrier to enable it to fly a version of the Joint Strike Fighter with a longer range and able to carry more weaponsâ.
10/05/2012,Lords,33,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"There is nothing there about any possibility of a problem over timescales or costs, or a need to look at timescales and costs. We were also told that,"
10/05/2012,Lords,34,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"âat the time of the SDSR, there was judged to be a very significant technical risk around the STOVL version of JSFâ."
10/05/2012,Lords,35,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"The technical risk was apparently so significant that it does not appear to have been referred to in the strategic defence and security review as a reason for the Governmentâs decision to switch the order for JSF aircraft, a decision they are now reversing."
10/05/2012,Lords,36,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"The fourth reason given for the change of approach is that,"
10/05/2012,Lords,37,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,âfurther work with our allies on the best approach to collaborative operation has satisfied us that joint maritime task groups involving our carriers â¦ is the more appropriate route to optimising alliance capabilitiesâ.
10/05/2012,Lords,38,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"Surely that is the kind of issue that should be considered at the time of a strategic defence and security review, not immediately after it. No doubt it could have been considered as part of the SDSR if the Government had not been so determined to rush it through and end up with the policy U-turn that we are being told about today."
10/05/2012,Lords,39,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"The Minister has told us in the Statement why the decision made by the previous Government on carrier strike capability was right and why the present Governmentâs policy has had to be abandoned. Perhaps the Minister can tell us the cost to the nation of the Governmentâs U-turn, and when the Government expect to make further announcements on their equipment programme in the light of Future Force 2020. Can the Minister also take this opportunity to put the record straight and confirm the National Audit Office finding that cancelling both carriers would have saved  1.2 billion but that, in government, his party agree that it is not in the national interest to do so?"
10/05/2012,Lords,40,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"At a time when cuts are having to be made, at the very least our Armed Forces deserve clarity and certainty of decision-making by the Government. On the subject of carrier strike capability that most definitely has not been the case. Since the Prime Minister took personal responsibility for this key decision in the strategic defence and security review, it is the Prime Ministerâs competence that has been found wanting."
10/05/2012,Lords,41,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"We support the policy U-turn announced today, which accepts that the previous Governmentâs decision was correct, but we do not support the taking of the wrong policy options previously by this Government under a rushed SDSR or the resultant waste of time and money. Let us hope that the decisions announced today will now provide our Armed Forces with the much needed clarity and certainty they deserve as far as carrier strike capability is concerned."
10/05/2012,Lords,42,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, it is a bit rich for the Opposition to criticise when it was they who scrapped the Sea Harriers, a decision that a senior naval officer described as,"
10/05/2012,Lords,43,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,âone of the most disastrous military decisions ever undertakenâ.
10/05/2012,Lords,44,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"It was they who pushed the in-service dates of the carriers back two years, which drove  1.6 billion of costs into the programme with no capability gain, a decision which the Public Accounts Committee said set,"
10/05/2012,Lords,45,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,âa new benchmark in poor corporate decision makingâ.
10/05/2012,Lords,46,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,I could go on.
10/05/2012,Lords,47,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"I may not be able to answer all the noble Lordâs questions but I undertake to write to him. First, he asked if the Prime Minister felt that the STOVL was the right aircraft. I can categorically say the answer is yes, under the changed circumstances since we made the decision in the SDSR. The House should be aware that we are talking about a very capable aircraft. We have spent a lot of time debating Harriers. The STOVL-variant is a very much more capable aircraft than Harrier. It has a genuine day and night capability; it is bigger, faster and can fly higher for longer, and can carry more weapons. It has low observability that is, stealth and greatly improved survivability. It is a fifth generation technology and its sensors and systems integration make it a high-performance tactical ISTAR asset. JCA places the UK at the forefront of fighter technology."
10/05/2012,Lords,48,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"The noble Lord said that he felt that the SDSR decision was wrong. The SDSR was about setting a strategic direction and we remain committed to  reintroducing a carrier strike capability around 2020, but the Government made clear then that if costs or facts changed, we would not just plough on regardless. We said that we would spend time and money examining the option of carrier conversion and that is what we have done. A âmain gateâ decision will necessarily be the subject of a much greater level of analysis than that conducted for the SDSR."
10/05/2012,Lords,49,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"The noble Lord pointed out that the B aircraft was on probation for a time. That is correct. As was said in the Statement, the STOVL programme was taken off probation in the United States in January 2012 after successful sea trials in November 2011 on board the USS âWaspâ. I have photographs here of the B-variant taking off from the USS âWaspâ which I am very happy to hand out to any noble Lord who would like them. The STOVL-variant is also required by the US Marine Corps and the Italian Navy. We are very grateful for the assistance that we have received from both the US Navy and the US Marine Corps."
10/05/2012,Lords,50,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"The noble Lord asked how much money we had wasted. As of the end of April, we had committed  39 million on conversion investigations and a further  1 million on an air-to-air refuelling study. We do not consider this money to have been wasted. Changing the variant was considered the best course of action at the time of the SDSR and these costs were necessarily incurred. Without a detailed investigation of the impact of carrier conversion, we would not have been in the position today to have identified the significant rise in estimated costs and made the decision to call a halt to this programme. I think that I have covered all the questions, but if there were any others, I will check Hansard and write to the noble Lord."
10/05/2012,Lords,51,Lord Lee of Trafford,Lords,LD,"My Lords, I join these Benches in the earlier tribute. Todayâs Statement marks another sad chapter in the saga of the aircraft carriers. It ill beholds the Opposition to crow and to adopt the pose that they did today in their heavy questioning."
10/05/2012,Lords,52,Lord Lee of Trafford,Lords,LD,"I have three questions. First, there appears to have been some change of heart or change of plan over the second carrier. My understanding was that the second would be mothballed, or possibly even sold; now it seems to be planned to be operated much more in tandem with the first carrier."
10/05/2012,Lords,53,Lord Lee of Trafford,Lords,LD,"My second question is about the overall cost of the carriers. Where are we up to with our latest forecast of the cost of the two carriers? Thirdly, will my noble friend say a little more about interoperability, particularly with the French carriers?"
10/05/2012,Lords,54,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, we have an aspiration to use the second carrier, but this will be an issue that the next SDSR, probably in 2015, will have to consider, particularly in the light of the cost of crewing it, which we estimate to be about  60 million a year. I can assure my noble friend that it is our aspiration to have the second carrier ready to assist when the first carrier goes in for a refit, or for any other reason."
10/05/2012,Lords,55,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,I feel uncomfortable giving my noble friend figures for the overall cost of the carriers. We are in discussions with industry and it would be wrong to reveal too many of those figures.
10/05/2012,Lords,56,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My noble friend asked finally about interoperability. The key intention agreed by the UK and France, which my noble friend mentioned, has always been to co-ordinate operations to ensure that when one country has a carrier in maintenance, the other has one available. Our ability to deliver this assurance will be enhanced should we ultimately decide to bring the second carrier into service. The US has made it clear that carrier availability, rather than cross-decking or the capability of aircraft, is the key issue for it."
10/05/2012,Lords,57,Lord Stirrup,Lords,Crossbench,"My Lords, in welcoming this decision, which is not only the right decision but, realistically, the only possible one, could I for the sake of clarity ask the Minister to confirm three points? First, will he confirm that the initial Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to be delivered to the United Kingdom, which will be instrumented aircraft for test and evaluation flying, will be STOVL variants and that this has always been the case, because, at the time of the SDSR, it was too late to change the choice of variant for those aircraft? Secondly, will he confirm that the first carrier, now in build, is being built without cats and traps and, again, that this always has always been the case, since, at the time of the SDSR, it was too late to change that? Thirdly, will he confirm that, as a consequence, the timescales for the delivery of the aircraft capability and the carrier capability have not changed from the pre-SDSR assumptions as a consequence of this excursion into carrier variant?"
10/05/2012,Lords,58,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and gallant Lord for his support. He and I sat through all the SDSR meetings and had to make the original decision. I can confirm to him that the first B-variant will be delivered in July this year and that the second one, I understand, will be delivered in October this year. They are both B-variants and both test aircraft. The third one, which will be delivered within 18 months, is also a B-variant so all the first three aircraft are B-variants."
10/05/2012,Lords,59,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,The noble and gallant Lord then asked me to confirm that the first carrier was being built without cats and traps and that the time when it would come into operation would not change. I can confirm that that is the case.
10/05/2012,Lords,60,Lord Gilbert,Lords,Con,"My Lords, I, too, welcome this Statement, which must have been very difficult for the Minister to deliver. It took him 13 minutes to read out the Secretary of Stateâs Statement, and all he had to do was get up and say, âSorry, you were right; we were wrongâ, but he did not do that. But that is where we are."
10/05/2012,Lords,61,Lord Gilbert,Lords,Con,"Leaving aside all that fog about changed circumstances, I was very interested in what he said about a refuelling study. Why on earth did the Ministry of Defence need to engage in a refuelling study? It was buying the plane from the Americans. Why did not just ask the Americans what arrangements they had or did not have? I suspect that the plane will not have any refuelling capability because it will probably do damage to the stealth of the aircraft."
10/05/2012,Lords,62,Lord Gilbert,Lords,Con,"While I greatly welcome this decision, I still do not think that we out of risk and danger completely with the B version of this aircraft. Less than a year ago,  Rear Admiral Venlet, the officer in charge of the whole programme in the United States, said that, so far, the F-35B is using more runway than desired in its short takeoffs and landings and that it cannot land vertically with as much payload as customers would like. I would be grateful if the Minister could speak to those two points. I am not too concerned about the second one, because you can always drop off fuel and ordinance that you have not used when you are trying to land, but concerns about the takeoff distance need careful attention and the Minister should explain to the House where we stand."
10/05/2012,Lords,63,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"I am grateful to the noble Lord for his measured welcome of the Statement. I have far too much respect for him to criticise him for his subsequent comments. I am not briefed on the refuelling study with the Americans; I will write to the noble Lord and put a copy of the letter in the Library of the House. I am not aware of the problems of runway and takeoff associated with the B-variant. All the briefing that I have had on that from Royal Naval officers and civil servants has been very positive. They are all very happy with the planeâs performance, but, again, I will write t the noble Lord on this issue of runway and takeoff."
10/05/2012,Lords,64,Lord Burnett,Lords,LD,"My Lords, I apologise for missing the first few minutes of the Statement. Will my noble friend explain what impact this decision will have on our amphibious capability and the amphibious role envisaged for these carriers?"
10/05/2012,Lords,65,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"I can assure my noble friend that we are doing quite a lot of work on this issue. Previous studies have shown that this decision may offer great flexibility in the employment of the carriers in other roles, particularly amphibious roles. The carriers are central to our amphibious assault capability and are a leading example of the expeditionary forces that underpin the core principles of the SDSR. I can assure my noble friend that there is plenty of room on the carriers to embark a good number of Royal Marines and to operate helicopters to support them. The B-variant can land on austere runways on land in support of ground troops."
10/05/2012,Lords,66,Lord Reid of Cardowan,Lords,Lab,"My Lords, the Minister rather led with his chin on occasions in his Statement when defending his predecessorâs decision. I am going to resist the temptation and keep my hand rather firmly in my pocket. I very much welcome the Statement made today by the Secretary of State, not least because it has reverted to a decision that was taken by the last Government on perfectly rational grounds and in which I played a minor role at the beginning. My colleague the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Ladyton, who is here today, played a much more major part."
10/05/2012,Lords,67,Lord Reid of Cardowan,Lords,Lab,"The truth of the matter is that it is the easiest thing in the world for a new Minister, in a fresh dawn, to overturn the recommendations and decisions of their predecessor. A lot of political kudos can be attracted to that a degree of bravura, a sense of decisiveness, ruthless leadership and so on. It is much more difficult for a Minister in a Government to overturn completely the decision of their immediate predecessor, and it  takes a great deal of courage to do that. There is no political kudos all that can be anticipated is criticism, âegg on faceâ quotes, and so on."
10/05/2012,Lords,68,Lord Reid of Cardowan,Lords,Lab,"I congratulate the Government and the Secretary of State on having made the right decisions for the right reasons this time. This is right for the Armed Forces, for the security of the country, for the Navy and above all for the people who serve in the Armed Forces. In passing this commendation to the Secretary of State, will the Minister urge him to apply the same scrutiny and rationale to various other aspects of the SDSR, which, on the evidence of todayâs decision, have been taken more in haste and in the pursuit of kudos than in the interests of national security of the country?"
10/05/2012,Lords,69,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord for his welcome. This was a very difficult decision but it was right for the Royal Navy and for the country. In taking this decision, my right honourableurable friend the Secretary of State made no criticism of his predecessorâs decision. Things have dramatically changed over the cats and traps, and obviously with the B-variant. I will take the noble Lordâs other point, on bringing the same scrutiny to other aspects of the SDSR, back to the department."
10/05/2012,Lords,70,Lord Davies of Stamford,Lords,Lab,"My Lords, I do not think that anyone is going to be deceived by the attempts by the Secretary of State to make party political points or to make people see this as anything other than a discreditable shambles. It is very unfortunate. The Government would have done better to have come forward with a slightly more humble line and to have confessed that they had made a mistake."
10/05/2012,Lords,71,Lord Davies of Stamford,Lords,Lab,"Can we hear how many aircraft the Government are now proposing to procure? We still have not heard that. Does the noble Lord accept and acknowledge that, because the B version carries a lot of its weight in the form of its own lift fan, its range is much less 400 miles against 700 miles for the CV version? Its payload is similarly reduced, and therefore more aircraft will be required to give a similar military effect. Are the Government planning to purchase more aircraft to procure the same military effect? Will the Minister also recognise that if we simply restrict ourselves to purchasing the F-35B, we will have no deep-strike bombing capability at all once the Tornados have been withdrawn? Do the Government have any plans at all to replace that lacuna in our capability, which will emerge by the end of the decade?"
10/05/2012,Lords,72,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, again I resent this criticism. I feel that it is the noble Lord who should be a little humble, particularly when the party oppositeâs last single year in office saw a staggering  3.3 billion increase in the total cost of the 15 largest defence equipment projects. The noble Lord asked me how many Joint Strike Fighter B-variants we are going to buy. In the first instance we intend to buy enough Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to build up our initial carrier strike capability. We do not intend to make final decisions on JSF numbers until our next strategic defence review, in 2015 at the earliest."
10/05/2012,Lords,73,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"I will just re-emphasise what the Statement said. We are getting our first and second aircraft this year. We are getting the first production aircraft in 2016. The first aircraft trials at sea, when we will have three aircraft, will be in 2018. The initial operational capability will be in 2020, when we will have eight useable aircraft. This is three years earlier than would be possible with the C-variant."
10/05/2012,Lords,74,Baroness Falkner of Margravine,Lords,LD,"My Lords, I accept that it must have been a very difficult decision to take, but clearly the sums involved point us in that direction. However, I thought that the most intriguing part of my noble friendâs Statement was that the Chief of the Defence Staff and his fellow chiefs,"
10/05/2012,Lords,75,Baroness Falkner of Margravine,Lords,LD,âendorse this decision as the quickest and most assured way now to deliver carrier strike as part of an overall affordable equipment programmeâ.
10/05/2012,Lords,76,Baroness Falkner of Margravine,Lords,LD,I wonder what the advice to the Secretary of State from the chiefs was when he came in in 2010. I suspect that my noble friend will not illuminate that point right now.
10/05/2012,Lords,77,Baroness Falkner of Margravine,Lords,LD,My other point is about the question of interoperability versus collaboration. This is clearly a setback to our co-operation with the French. The lessons of Libya will have told us that it is vital that we continue to collaborate with them. Will he reassure us that we will continue to work with them to optimise our joint capabilities?
10/05/2012,Lords,78,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, taking my noble friendâs second question first, I can reassure her on that point. I have had a number of discussions with the French military at all levels, and am very keen on pushing our relations with it. As for the chiefs giving their support, I understand that they all put their support in writing to No. 10. I cannot answer now the question about the advice that the Secretary of State received in 2010, but my noble friend might want to have a word with the noble and gallant Lord afterwards."
10/05/2012,Lords,79,Lord West of Spithead,Lords,Lab,"My Lords, this is clearly the correct decision, but I have two questions for the Minister. The first continues the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lee. The decision that had been taken before was that we were going to have STOVL and run two carriers. Looking at this Statement in detail, it is not at all clear that we are really going to run two carriers. It would be dreadful if, after all this going round in circles like an oozlum bird for two years, we end up with only one carrier running. I hope that we can be more positive about the fact that we will run two in order to ensure that we have a carrier 100% of the time, because that is good for the nation and for the defence of this country."
10/05/2012,Lords,80,Lord West of Spithead,Lords,Lab,"My second point runs on from that. Perhaps the Minister could get across to the Secretary of State, and to the rest of his Front Bench, that this is good news. We have a 65,000-tonne ship because if you surge 26 Joint Strike Fighters, of whatever variant, it has to be that size. It is not because some admiral woke up and thought, âGosh, Iâll have a big shipâ. It is done for a reason. We should be very proud that this nation is building two of them. Let us get a bit of  whoomph and say, âRight, weâve made a decision, this is a fantastic thing, tens of thousands of people are working producing these things and they will protect and look after our nation for 50 yearsâ."
10/05/2012,Lords,81,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, the second carrier is, as I said, an aspiration and we very much hope it will be possible. We will certainly always have one carrier at sea. The decision on the second one will have to wait until 2015, but it is our aspiration that it is going to happen. As for the noble Lordâs point about it being a good news story, of course it is a good news story and we are very proud of British industry. I was up in Rosyth and Govan a couple of weeks ago and saw the work. I am enormously proud of what we are producing up there."
10/05/2012,Lords,82,Lord Lyell,Lords,Con,"My Lords, I hope there is time for one quick question from a mere accountant. Can my noble friend confirm the wise words of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, about the effectiveness and competence of the new STOVL version? I believe that we shall make a major saving in the cat and trap system, although there may be some shortfall in deliverability of the particular weapons system in the distance. Can he write to me, or let me have this afternoon, a quick sum on the saving of the cat and trap system, not least the time and availability in 2017-18 of the new version?"
10/05/2012,Lords,83,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, I will be happy to write to my noble friend. I have a lot of figures here with which I shall not weary the House. I can tell him that to convert the âQueen Elizabethâ to cats and traps after she is built would cost between  2.5 billion and  3 billion."
10/05/2012,Lords,84,Lord Greenway,Lords,Crossbench,"My Lords, are we not in danger of short-termism? Following what the noble Lord, Lord West, just said, we will, we hope, end up with two immensely useful platforms that will last for 40 or 50 years and that will be able to take all sorts of strange aircraft about which we do not yet know. Therefore, the project going ahead as it is now is most useful."
10/05/2012,Lords,85,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"No, my Lords, I do not think that it is short-termism. We are in very good company with the B-variant. The US Marine Corps uses it; it is buying a lot of Joint Strike Fighters. The Italians are also going to buy them for their carrier. It is not short-termism at all."
10/05/2012,Lords,86,Lord Foulkes of Cumnock,Lords,Lab,"My Lords, although everyone seems happy that we are now back on the right track, can the Minister give us an estimate of the extra abortive expenditure involved in the unnecessary adventure of cat and trap?"
10/05/2012,Lords,87,Lord Astor of Hever,"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence",Con,"My Lords, I have already given an answer to the second question. I will read it out again, but before I do I must say that I am very grateful to the noble Lord for assuring me that we are on the right track. I said that at the end of April we had committed  39 million to conversion investigations and a further  1 million to an air-to-air refuelling  study. We do not consider that money to have been wasted. Changing variant was considered the best course of action at the time of the SDSR and those costs were necessarily incurred. Without a detailed investigation of the impact of carrier conversion, we would not have been in a position today to identify the significant rise in estimated costs and to decide to call a halt to the programme."
11/06/2012,Commons,1,Guy Opperman,Hexham,Con,What plans he has for maintaining aircraft carrier cover in co-operation with key allies.
11/06/2012,Commons,2,Peter Luff,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"The strategic defence and security review confirmed the Governmentâs intention to re-introduce a carrier strike capability from around 2020. This capability will be delivered by the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier, operating the STOVL  short take-off and vertical landing variant of the joint strike fighter. Until then, the Government have accepted that expeditionary air power will need to be deployed by other means, which may include agreements with allies regarding overflight and basing rights. In addition, the Government are considering the scope for us to co-ordinate carrier strike operations with those NATO allies that currently operate aircraft carriers, including the United States, France and Italy, both prior to and following the re-introduction of the United Kingdomâs own capability."
11/06/2012,Commons,3,Guy Opperman,Hexham,Con,Our future aircraft carriers are being built by our Scottish allies. What happens to the construction of those carriers if Scotland declares independence and does not contribute to the cost?
11/06/2012,Commons,4,Peter Luff,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"As a good Unionist, I must emphasise that the carriers are being built by the United Kingdom, and that many English yards, as well as Scottish yards, are making a fine contribution to these outstanding ships. The best thing that I can say to my honourable Friend is that it is two thirds of a century since the United Kingdom built a warship outside the UK that happened during the second world war so the facts speak for themselves."
11/06/2012,Commons,5,Nick Smith,Blaenau Gwent,Lab,"The Telegraph conservatively says that it is  250 million, but can the Minister say how much the bad decision to proceed with the F-35C cost? Surely this should include the costs of carrier conversion, too."
11/06/2012,Commons,6,Peter Luff,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I can confirm what my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State has said on many occasions: as of the end of April, we had committed  39 million on conversion studies and a further  1 million on an air-to-air  refuelling study. We do not think that the money has been wasted. Changing the variant was considered the best course of action under the SDSR, and these costs were necessarily incurred."
11/06/2012,Commons,7,Dr Julian Lewis,New Forest East,Con,Can my honourable Friend confirm that it is our intention to build the two carriers so that both are able to operate fixed-wing aircraft and that we will purchase enough fixed-wing aircraft to operate from both of those carriers?
11/06/2012,Commons,8,Peter Luff,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I can confirm that both carriers will be built; it will be a decision in the next SDSR as to whether or not both are operated. Similarly, we are following an incremental acquisition policy on the joint strike fighter itself. Therefore, I cannot give my honourable Friend the comfort he is seeking at this stage, as this relates to a commercial negotiation and a strategic decision for the next SDSR."
25/02/2013,Commons,1,Diana Johnson,Kingston upon Hull North,Lab,What progress his Department has made on the aircraft carrier programme.
25/02/2013,Commons,2,Andy Sawford,Corby,Lab/Co-op,What progress his Department has made on the aircraft carrier programme.
25/02/2013,Commons,3,Philip Dunne,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"While I am on my feet and with your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I wish to correct the impression that I may have given in answer to a previous question. The thousands of jobs in Scotland supporting the deterrent are, of course, in Faslane. The other thousands of jobs in Scotland supporting the construction of the QEII class of aircraft carrier the subject of these questions are at Rosyth. "
25/02/2013,Commons,4,Philip Dunne,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"There are now more than 30,000 tonnes of ship in the dock at Rosyth. The forward and aft island structures, containing the shipâs bridges, funnels and radar masts, will be fitted in the coming months, followed by the final hull and flight deck sections. The ship will be largely structurally complete by the end of this year and she will be floated off next year. Construction of HMS Prince of Wales is also well under way, with all the lower block units in build."
25/02/2013,Commons,5,Diana Johnson,Kingston upon Hull North,Lab,"The Select Committee on Defence says that the coalitionâs double U-turn on aircraft carriers has cost taxpayers  100 million-plus, and we face years without carrier capability. With Hull considering a bid for the decommissioned HMS Illustrious, is the Minister aware that even Hull might soon have one more aircraft carrier than the Royal Navy?"
25/02/2013,Commons,6,Philip Dunne,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"As the honourable Lady has heard already today, the National Audit Office criticised the previous Administration for introducing a delay to the aircraft carrier that cost the taxpayer  1.6 billion, so the Government will not take lessons on how to run a major procurement programme."
25/02/2013,Commons,7,Andy Sawford,Corby,Lab/Co-op,"Will the Minister confirm that the Governmentâs plans on whether a second aircraft carrier will be deployed will be based on the unit cost of the joint strike fighter, which is still unknown due to budgetary uncertainty in America?"
25/02/2013,Commons,8,Philip Dunne,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"As the honourable Gentleman should know, decisions on the deployment of the second aircraft carrier will be made in the 2015 strategic defence review."
25/02/2013,Commons,9,Mr Julian Brazier,Canterbury,Con,"I welcome my honourable Friendâs commitment to this programme. Will he confirm that the aircraft carriers will be the largest in British history, and can I urge him not to let anyone put him off building them?"
25/02/2013,Commons,10,Philip Dunne,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"My honourable Friend is a redoubtable champion for all matters to do with the armed forces. He is aware that the 65,000 tonne aircraft carriers that will form the Queen Elizabeth class will be not only the largest aircraft carriers ever built in this country, but the largest naval ships ever built in this country."
27/11/2017,Commons,1,Tom Tugendhat,Tonbridge and Malling,Con,What progress he has made on bringing the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier into service.
27/11/2017,Commons,2,Harriett Baldwin,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,HMS Queen Elizabeth has returned to Portsmouth after a successful second set of sea trials. Her commissioning ceremony is planned for 7 December in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen. The handover to the Royal Navy from the contractor is planned for the end of the year.
27/11/2017,Commons,3,Tom Tugendhat,Tonbridge and Malling,Con,"Does my honourable Friend agree that there is now a sense of urgency? Not only are we planning a global future for ourselves, which will require a greater presence around the world, but with the royal wedding coming as early as next year, and with the absence of the yacht Britannia, is there not a possibility that the new prince and princess will require something to sail around the seas?"
27/11/2017,Commons,4,Harriett Baldwin,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I certainly was not anticipating that line of questioning from my honourable Friend, the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, but he is absolutely right that this new class of aircraft carrier will give a powerful expression of national ambition and intent. They are versatile and agile ships and will be able to perform a wide range of maritime security roles."
27/11/2017,Commons,5,Vernon Coaker,Gedling,Lab,"Will the Minister confirm that the Government see the future of the Queen Elizabeth, when it comes into service, as an aircraft carrier and not as meeting defence cuts by replacing amphibious landing craft such as HMS Bulwark and HMS Albion?"
27/11/2017,Commons,6,Harriett Baldwin,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"I am delighted to confirm that we have not only one aircraft carrier but a second aircraft carrier, which is now structurally complete, at Rosyth. Of course, there will be adaptations to ensure that the carriers are able to support the full range of helicopters in our fleet, but we have absolutely confirmed that we will have a full range of maritime capabilities from these two remarkable and adaptable ships."
27/11/2017,Commons,7,Mr Simon Clarke,Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland,Con,"It will be essential that we have sufficient surface fleet to provide escort capability for the carriers. Will the Minister confirm that we will indeed have sufficient of the Type 31s and that, where possible, they will be made from UK steel?"
27/11/2017,Commons,8,Harriett Baldwin,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"My honourable Friend is absolutely right. To give just one example, today in Portsmouth one of the new Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability tankers has been commissioned into the Navy. There are six Type 45 destroyers. We cut steel on the first of eight new anti-submarine frigates, and we are running the competition for the Type 31e global general purpose frigate."
27/11/2017,Commons,9,Gerald Jones,Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney,Lab,"HMS Diamond recently had to abandon its operations because of issues with its propeller. This means that none of the  1 billion Type 45 destroyers, which have been riddled with issues, is currently at sea. Given the important role that they will play in supporting the carriers, what urgent action are the Government taking to remedy these issues?"
27/11/2017,Commons,10,Harriett Baldwin,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence,Con,"There is of course a limit to what we can comment on with regard to the specifics of the situation, but I can assure the honourable Gentleman that as part of our regular force deployment we will be regenerating that capability, and the Royal Navy is able to meet all its operational capabilities around the world."
