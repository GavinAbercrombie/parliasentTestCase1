02/02/2010,Commons,1,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,I am pleased to have secured this Adjournment debate about planned major improvements to a transport route that is of considerable importance not only to many of my constituents in Bedford and Kempston but to hundreds of thousands of other people along the route and those who use its many connections. It is also crucial to the economy of London and a wide area north and south of the capital.
02/02/2010,Commons,2,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Since I first sought this debate, we have unfortunately experienced the serious deterioration of the rail service operated by First Capital Connect. Therefore, before completing my presentation, it would be entirely remiss of me not to take the opportunity to raise some points about that, not only to reflect the inconvenience suffered by my constituents and others but because what has happened raises some legitimate questions about capability to deliver the much improved service to passengers promised by the Thameslink programme. I shall return to those matters later."
02/02/2010,Commons,3,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I am pleased to see many honourable Members present for this debate, especially fellow members of the all-party Thameslink route group my honourable Friends the Members for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper) and for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), and the honourable Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam) and others such as my honourable Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton). I apologise for not referring to the others who are here. I do not think that they have signed up to the all-party group, but they can do so later."
02/02/2010,Commons,4,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Some of us have benefited from opportunities to inspect aspects of the Thameslink programme works, for which we are grateful to Network Rail, First Capital Connect and various construction companies. The Thameslink service has become such an accepted part of the transport infrastructure of south-east England that it is easy to forget how relatively recently it came about. The electrification of the midlands suburban route between St. Pancras, Moorgate and Bedford had already been started by a previous Labour Government in the late 1970s, when the idea of joining it up with what was then known as the Southern region began to be discussed."
02/02/2010,Commons,5,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"British Rail engineers devised a plan to reopen the Snow Hill tunnel route between Farringdon and Holborn Viaduct stations, a route that had not seen a passenger train since Lloyd George was in Downing street, and from which the last freight service had been withdrawn in 1970. The plan initially was for some kind of shuttle between West Hampstead and south London, but the project eventually grew to become Thameslink: a full-blown network of services linking Bedford and Luton in the north with Gatwick and Brighton in the south via the City of London, with an additional loop serving Wimbledon."
02/02/2010,Commons,6,Mr. Andrew Pelling,"Croydon, Central",Ind,"I apologise that I am not a member of the honourable Gentleman s all-party Thameslink route group. Someone who represents East Croydon station should definitely be a member of such a group. Would he agree that the small public sector investment in that station was important because it ended up relieving a great deal of stress and strain in terms of cross-London passenger traffic? Does that not emphasise how important it is for the Government to continue to be supportive of such initiatives? Huge amounts of money are being proposed for Crossrail, but north-south movements are just as important as east-west movements in the whole south-east and London area."
02/02/2010,Commons,7,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"The honourable Gentleman anticipates my comments, although I shall not speak against any other project. Crossrail is important as well, but I agree with the fundamental point that we must commit to this programme, and I will say so later on."
02/02/2010,Commons,8,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I shall give a little of the history, because it is sometimes helpful to put things in that context. A special fleet of dual-voltage trains was ordered from British Rail Engineering which were able to draw electrical power from overhead cables north of Snow Hill and from the third rail to the south of it. Full service was introduced in 1988 and became an immediate success. Indeed, we all recognise that it quickly became the victim of its own success: overcrowding and standing room only became the norm at peak times. I would have liked to illustrate that with passenger numbers for 1988, when the service started, for 2000 and for last year, but, unfortunately and unacceptably, I have been informed that the Department for Transport will not release such figures on the grounds of commercial sensitivity."
02/02/2010,Commons,9,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Whether overcrowding is official or not, commuters on the Thameslink route certainly have good reason to feel that they endure unacceptably overcrowded conditions at peak times. The Bedford to Brighton line features in the top 10 most crowded in every survey. Indeed, some research by Network Rail has revealed that 50 per cent. of regular peak-time Thameslink users claim that sometimes the train is so full that they cannot get on it at all. [Interruption.] Like London underground."
02/02/2010,Commons,10,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Overcrowding was recognised by British Rail, which sought to address it and to widen the scope of the Thameslink service through the Thameslink 2000 programme, which, unfortunately, became mired in the fallout from the chaotic privatisation of the railways and also the complexity of dealing with issues around the Town and Country Planning Acts, especially in south-east London. But, eventually, thanks to the hard work and determination of many, mostly in the public sector, and the robustness of the business case itself, in 2007 the Government were able to give the go-ahead for the Thameslink programme."
02/02/2010,Commons,11,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"The main part of the Thameslink route covers 140 miles of railway and 50 stations between Bedford and Brighton. It interchanges with major rail hubs at St. Pancras and London Bridge, plus international airports at Luton and Gatwick. The core section, from St. Pancras to Blackfriars, carries more passengers than Heathrow airport every day. The Thameslink programme aims to deliver a massive increase in rail capacity through longer trains and high-frequency services, and, in so doing, should indirectly help to tackle overcrowding on other railway lines and parts of the London underground."
02/02/2010,Commons,12,Mr. Mark Field,Cities of London and Westminster,Con,"The honourable Gentleman rightly makes the case for the benefits of extending Thameslink to each and every one of the 50 stations from the Sussex coast up to mid and, indeed, north Bedfordshire, but does he recognise that ensuring that we have sufficient capacity in the centre of London this obviously applies to the Crossrail debate as well as to the Thameslink debate is of crucial importance if there is not to be the overcrowding to which he referred earlier?"
02/02/2010,Commons,13,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Indeed, the whole of the programme is predicated upon delivering that capacity through engineering changes and improvements in the core, in central London."
02/02/2010,Commons,14,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"The scope of the Thameslink network opened up by engineering improvements in the core, which have just been referred to, will greatly increase beyond the Bedford-Brighton corridor, extending to Peterborough, Cambridge and King s Lynn in the north and to a large number of destinations south of London. Work is well under way in delivering the Thameslink programme. The first phase was completed on time and on budget in March 2009, and essentially prepared for the main construction phase that we are now in, but we should not take that preparation for granted, as it was all about enabling services to run as smoothly as possible during the main construction phase."
02/02/2010,Commons,15,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"We have already benefited from a superb new station at St. Pancras International, which replaced the appalling King s Cross Thameslink, and we will soon see delivery of a new station at Blackfriars, which will span the Thames. It will be ready in time for 2012. Farringdon station has been transformed, including preparation for an interchange with Crossrail, which will greatly increase connectivity for millions of people throughout the Thameslink network as well as east-west along Crossrail itself."
02/02/2010,Commons,16,Simon Hughes,North Southwark and Bermondsey,LD,"The honourable Gentleman knows that I have had disagreements with Thameslink over its choice of the route through London Bridge and the consequent potential effects on Borough market. The battle was fought and lost, so we will have to wait to see whether Borough market survives with the character that it has had. However, the extension from Blackfriars to the south bank is extremely welcome and will do what has been necessary for a long time to link that station to others, although it is a short walk to the Jubilee line, and to make all sorts of other connections possible. That is a very exciting opportunity, and those of us on the south bank look forward very much to the station s opening."
02/02/2010,Commons,17,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I am sure they do. As far as the Thameslink programme is concerned, some people think that Bermondsey is the centre of the universe. I am pleased to see the honourable Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) in the Chamber. I did not mention his name when I began my speech because I do not think that he was here then, but he is a welcome member of the all-party group that I mentioned."
02/02/2010,Commons,18,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Outside London, work is proceeding to extend station platforms to accommodate the new 12-car trains. Phase 3 is London Bridge, which is the most congested place on the whole network: the result of the unplanned approach to railway construction in the capital during the 19th century, creating a railway headache that no one has really sought to tackle until now. London Bridge is crucial to the success of the programme and will unlock the railway and release capacity for 24 trains an hour through the core."
02/02/2010,Commons,19,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I recently submitted 10 written parliamentary questions to the Department for Transport to check on the progress of this vital scheme. I compliment my honourable Friend the Minister on the fact that most were answered within 24 hours. I should have asked about passenger numbers and I will. His Department told me that some 1,500 construction workers are currently employed full time on the Thameslink programme, with a further 500 to 700 working part time."
02/02/2010,Commons,20,David Lepper,"Brighton, Pavilion",Lab/Co-op,"I suspect that my honourable Friend will give us some more information about the number of workers employed on the scheme. Does he share my concern that possible redundancies of some of Network Rail s engineering staff could compromise not only the Thameslink programme, but important maintenance work in the whole Southern region?"
02/02/2010,Commons,21,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I understand that there are concerns about maintenance on the whole rail network. This is not the place to go into detail on that, although those concerns are certainly shared by many honourable Members. By having such a debate, we put these issues firmly on the agenda and help to get them addressed later, which I hope will happen."
02/02/2010,Commons,22,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Mentioning the people employed in the Thameslink project helps to reinforce the point that public transport infrastructure schemes can provide much-needed employment during a recession, when the construction sector is always the first to feel the pain. I have also been informed that an additional 80 train drivers will need to be recruited to operate the additional services from around 2013 onwards. I will say something about driver vacancies and recruitment before concluding."
02/02/2010,Commons,23,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Through written answers I have learned that the first of the new 12-car and eight-car trains is expected to be delivered by the end of 2013. There is some time to go before that happens and I hope that my long-suffering constituents will be able to stomach that wait, but at least it is coming."
02/02/2010,Commons,24,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"The programme is costing between  5.5 billion and  6 billion, which is a little more than was originally estimated. This information apparently led to briefings or leaks to The Observer newspaper, which reported on 15 November 2008 that the Thameslink programme was facing   750 million of cutbacks in a Treasury crackdown on costly infrastructure projects ù and that  According to unidentified rail industry sources, the number of trains passing through central London at peak times could be cut from 24 services per hour to 20 ù, which would be most unfortunate."
02/02/2010,Commons,25,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"There has also been speculation about the orders for the new trains and the 1,100 new carriages for the Thameslink network as a whole, which are due to be awarded either by the end of March or during the summer or autumn. I hope that we get some clarity on that situation."
02/02/2010,Commons,26,Mr. Bob Laxton,"Derby, North",Lab,"It is crucial for my constituents and for the rail industry in total that this order goes to the only UK-based train assembler or manufacturer that is left in the country. I find it ironic that after 150 years or more of the rail industry, if this order went to a company outside the UK, it could be the end of train manufacturing here in the UK and with it could go many jobs: 2,500 in Derby and 12,000 or thereabouts in the supply chain. It is crucial that this contract goes ahead and equally crucial that it is awarded to a UK-based company."
02/02/2010,Commons,27,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I understand my honourable Friend s point and share his view. Of course, the process for dealing with bids must be above board."
02/02/2010,Commons,28,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"When Bombardier failed to deliver the 23 new train units last March I visited it and was impressed: it put its hands up, did not blame anyone else and said that it had made mistakes. In fact, some of Bombardier s suppliers had got into serious difficulties because of the recession and it took over some of the supply chain to ensure that the delivery was completed. Only two weeks ago the last of the 23 trains was delivered, which has caused all kinds of knock-on effects. I was impressed by Bombardier s positive attitude and the fact that it made no excuses whatsoever."
02/02/2010,Commons,29,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"The degree of state subsidy in railway systems around the world is an interesting question that I would happy to debate on another occasion. It is a matter of choice for Governments. Peak-time travel in this country is expensive, but off-peak travel is often much cheaper than in many other continental countries."
02/02/2010,Commons,30,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,rose 
02/02/2010,Commons,31,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I will be speaking for a long time if I take interventions on the cost of travel to the passenger. None the less, my honourable Friend persuades me to give way."
02/02/2010,Commons,32,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,I am most grateful to my honourable Friend. I will be brief. Does he accept that a major cause of the rise in the cost of fares in Britain is privatisation? The costs of laying track have increased by five times and maintenance costs have increased by four times. That is why fares have had to rise.
02/02/2010,Commons,33,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"If my honourable Friend wishes to secure an Adjournment debate on the case for public ownership of the national asset that is the rail network, I shall be there with him."
02/02/2010,Commons,34,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"We all know that concern about public finances is high on the political agenda. The Government s deficit-reduction plan will include tough departmental cuts and the official Opposition have stated that the country has run out of money, that we face a decade of austerity and that an emergency Budget will follow within 50 days of a Conservative election victory. I state as firmly as I can that the Thameslink programme must be delivered: no delays, no dilution. It is essential on social, economic and environmental grounds. The business case depends on completion of the major works at London Bridge, which must not be cut. Indeed, it turns out that the programme is integral to supporting the economy as we emerge from the recession. If anyone doubts this, they should ask the passengers along the route, including my constituents. Up to  6 billion is a lot of money, but this is an extremely cost-effective use of money. To cut back on the final phase London Bridge would put the brake on the part of the programme that will deliver the biggest benefit. It would be short-sighted, foolish and a tragedy to do so."
02/02/2010,Commons,35,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"I hope that the honourable Gentleman agrees that we cannot stop-start railway projects, which are long-term projects that, once committed to, should be followed through and, if curtailed, would be a cost to the public purse. Does he agree that it would help if, prior to the election, all three parties committed to proceeding with the Thameslink programme as planned? May I say, to start the ball rolling, that the Liberal Democrats do so?"
02/02/2010,Commons,36,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I certainly endorse that example of parties working together in the country s interests, because that is what should happen sometimes. We will have an opportunity today to hear about that if someone picks up that helpful suggestion."
02/02/2010,Commons,37,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Before concluding with questions to the Minister, I shall speak about First Capital Connect. I appreciate that there will be an Adjournment debate on the subject tomorrow, so I need not go into great detail, as I could, but issues arise that are relevant to how trains will operate on completion of the Thameslink programme."
02/02/2010,Commons,38,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I acknowledge the disruption, inconvenience and additional cost borne by many of my constituents and thousands of others from mid-November to the end of January. That arose principally from the decision of drivers, mostly at the Bedford depot, to work only their contracted hours, and not to volunteer to work on their rest days. That was connected with FirstGroup s decision to offer a pay award that included a 0 per cent. increase for the first year. However, negotiations were still proceeding with ASLEF, and there was no need, in terms of collective bargaining procedures, for the unofficial action. It seems that the situation was bound up with frustration owing to disruption and delay of promised training, triggered by Bombardier s failure it was not entirely its fault, as I acknowledged to deliver 23 new class 377 trains between October 2008 and March 2009, and principally because of knock-on effects of First Capital s taking on the new Bedford-Sevenoaks service. That combination created difficulties in delivering the driver training that FCC had promised. Suffice it to say that FCC must now demonstrate to the public and the Government that it will get on top of its industrial relations and help to restore the good will that is essential to running the railway."
02/02/2010,Commons,39,David Lepper,"Brighton, Pavilion",Lab/Co-op,"Does my honourable Friend agree that First Capital Connect should have been swifter in coming forward with a compensation package for regular travellers on the line, and does he share my hope that even now it will widen the scope of that package?"
02/02/2010,Commons,40,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Because things were happening so fast daily, and with the exceptional weather, it was probably difficult to please everyone instantly. People always want more compensation, and the latest offer, which I believe is about to go online, is much more generous than was mooted earlier. Some of my constituents may not be happy with it, but on balance I have concluded that the compensation package is now reasonable and fair. FCC has taken on additional staff to cope with the demands and claims, and I believe that it is determined to learn lessons for industrial relations and compensation from its dreadful experience."
02/02/2010,Commons,41,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"The period during which drivers started to work to contract, leading to the emergency timetable and the 50 per cent. reduction in the service from Bedford, led to all sorts of claims about driver numbers and vacancies. I have heard all sorts of suggestions about the number of unfilled vacancies, which I have not yet got to the bottom of, but I am determined to do so, and it is in the public interest that the House does so. Whatever Department for Transport officials say is commercially confidential, I ask the industry to be clear and open with the public, because that will help to restore confidence."
02/02/2010,Commons,42,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"When FCC took over the franchise in 2006, it proceeded to recruit 30 extra drivers 13 were recruited after April 2009, and 16 more were recruited after November beyond the normal recruitment level needed to cope with retirement and so on. The extra trains integral to the Thameslink service will generate further recruitment needs. I have been assured that FCC has in place mechanisms to review the establishment regularly to ensure that the enhanced service made possible by the Thameslink programme is delivered."
02/02/2010,Commons,43,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"FCC must acknowledge that the difficulties created for passengers by the drivers  work-to-contract episode, and later the snow and ice, were greatly exacerbated by an incompetent communications system. Again, I am confident that lessons have been learned, and that improvements will be made over the next several months. FCC is spending money on that. I have referred to the point about compensation made by my honourable Friend the Member for Luton, North."
02/02/2010,Commons,44,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"I shall conclude with some questions to the Minister. Will he confirm the Government s unwavering commitment to completion of the whole of the Thameslink project as already programmed? Will he tell me, now or later, what proportion of the overall benefit will be delivered by completion of phase 3, which is officially, if clumsily, known as key output 2 that is, London Bridge? Will he tell me why delivery of the 1,100 new carriages in the form of 12-car and 8-car units does not coincide with the planned completion of the Thameslink programme? The latter is 2012, but the new trains are apparently due at the end of 2013. Will the Minister confirm when the preferred bidder to supply the new trains will be announced, and when the contract will be placed?"
02/02/2010,Commons,45,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"The Minister will know that First Capital Connect encountered further problems during the cold weather because the sliding doors on the class 319 units froze tight due to snow penetration. That did not happen throughout the network on trains fitted with plug doors. As the 1,100 new carriages will have sliding and not plug doors, will he reconsider that specification?"
02/02/2010,Commons,46,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"FCC is addressing the need for improvements that it can deliver on passenger and station staff information, but industry-wide issues are being examined by the Minister s Department, with Network Rail and train operators as a whole. Is he in a position to apprise me and the House of progress and a programme of action? "
02/02/2010,Commons,47,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Will my honourable Friend tell me what might happen to the Bedford depot and sidings when the 12-car trains are introduced? I understand that there is insufficient space to accommodate trains of that length, which are of the fixed formation type, so they cannot be broken up."
02/02/2010,Commons,48,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"Finally, it is in the public interest to know about passenger numbers."
02/02/2010,Commons,49,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,"There is always more to add, but despite the problems of the past two and a half months, we are approaching a time when the congestion and overcrowding of the past 20 years will be overcome. That is good and positive news, and an outcome to which I hope everyone is committed."
02/02/2010,Commons,50,Several honourable Members,NA,NA,rose 
02/02/2010,Commons,51,Mr. Edward O'Hara,in the Chair,NA,Order. I remind honourable Members who wish to contribute to the debate that the Front-Bench contributions must start not later than 12 o clock.
02/02/2010,Commons,52,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"I congratulate the honourable Member for Bedford on securing this debate. He is an energetic chairman of the all-party group on the Thameslink route, and I am an enthusiastic supporter of that group. As he said, the core part of that important project is the bit between St. Pancras and Blackfriars, but the third stage, to which he referred, is the improvements that we will get up to 2015 unfortunately rather a long way away to the Borough market junction and London Bridge station, which are equally important to the project. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the project because I represent people in south London and Orpington who use that service. As the honourable Gentleman knows, there have been huge problems with congestion of services through London Bridge station over many years because of the historical bottleneck resulting from unplanned development of railways during the 19th century. The problem was not tackled during the 20th century, and it is amazing that we have had to wait until the 21st century."
02/02/2010,Commons,53,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"Perhaps I can read out a short section of a letter that amply exemplifies the problems faced by my constituents. On 8 January, a lady wrote to Southeastern Trains about a train journey that took place between London Bridge and Orpington on 7 January:"
02/02/2010,Commons,54,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"I wish to make a strong complaint about the overcrowding on the above train I was unable to move or breathe easily. It was not possible to remove my hat, gloves or answer my mobile phonourable. With lots of layers of clothing on and my coat ù  obviously, January 7 was a very cold day   I was unable to stop myself from overheating. I can honourablestly say you were lucky no one was injured in my carriage...There was no security or help from the platform before leaving London Bridge Thoughts were going through my mind of the Heysel stadium ù."
02/02/2010,Commons,55,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"It does get that bad on some of these overcrowded commuter trains at certain times of day or night. That letter, written this year, indicates the daily problems that my constituents are facing, which, hopefully, will be alleviated in years to come by the Thameslink programme."
02/02/2010,Commons,56,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"The problem is not simply one of overcrowding on a daily basis, but of some of the choices that the Southeastern Trains operating company has to make. For example, it has had to cancel the only services between Orpington, Petts Wood and New Cross an important area of employment for my constituents with Goldsmiths college and so on to put in a new service to Lewisham to serve Canary Wharf. Obviously, Canary Wharf is also a source of employment for my constituents, but Southeastern Trains has had to choose between the two because the capacity constraints on that line are such that there cannot be both. That is frankly ridiculous in the 21st century."
02/02/2010,Commons,57,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"That is the overcrowding problem that we face. As we know, the notes sent out by Network Rail for this debate stated:"
02/02/2010,Commons,58,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con," The track and signalling around London Bridge is the most complicated and congested in Europe. By   untangling  the rail infrastructure at London Bridge we can deliver the massive capacity increase that 100,000s of passengers need and a high frequency service through central London. ù."
02/02/2010,Commons,59,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"That is what we are looking for. I appreciate the point made by the honourable Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) who is also a member of the all-party group on the Thameslink route about the serious conflict between Borough market and the needs of passenger services in that area. It is a great pity that the problem has had to be resolved with some disadvantage to Borough market. The market is a wonderful piece of London s heritage, and although the solution that has been reached means some truncation of Borough market, I hope that it will none the less mean that the service can provide for what is an important part of south-east London s history."
02/02/2010,Commons,60,Simon Hughes,North Southwark and Bermondsey,LD,"I am grateful for the honourable Gentleman s sensitive reference to that issue. Only time will tell, although we will lose some listed buildings and the whole configuration will be different. I accept the case for having more lines to London Bridge, but the only issue that has not yet been resolved is that of ensuring that the South London line has enough platforms and can continue its loop round from Victoria. The Minister is aware of that point, as I have been to see him. That is the one remaining piece of engineering organisation that, if it could be resolved, would considerably help people in our part of the world."
02/02/2010,Commons,61,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"I am sure that the Minister will hear what the honourable Gentleman has said. The final point made by the honourable Member for Bedford, quite rightly, is that this programme should not be cut. The honourable Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) strongly supported that, and it is certainly uppermost in our minds. This programme should not be cut and we should be committed to it."
02/02/2010,Commons,62,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"Unfortunately, I must point out to the honourable Member for Bedford that his Government have presided over an economic crisis that has led to the spending of billions of pounds that could otherwise go towards this sort of infrastructure. Equally, they have squandered public funds on a heroic perhaps I should say unheroic scale, as a result of which, productivity in the public sector has gone down. There is a problem that we must face realistically."
02/02/2010,Commons,63,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"The sort of solution we need was set out on 26 January in the Financial Times, which pointed out that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has already announced cuts in capital expenditure of about one half over the next four or five years. Our worry is that the project under discussion could be included in that sort of cut. It was pointed out that we could match up the funds of the pensions industry, for example, which need long-term revenue to service, with the income flows from such transport infrastructure. That could provide an alternative source of financing for these big projects, apart from public sector funds. Unfortunately, we have a rather unhappy history with the private finance initiative, which, again, has not been handled well by the Government. If we are to save such projects, alternative ways of financing the transport infrastructure must be taken into account and used imaginatively. It is vital that such projects go ahead."
02/02/2010,Commons,64,Mr. John Horam,Orpington,Con,"Recently, I was on a trip with the Foreign Affairs Committee to Madrid and Lisbon, and I saw for myself the effect on a capital city of modern transport services and roads of course, in those cases there was access to large amounts of European Union funds. One can see the galvanising effect that that sort of infrastructure has on quality of life, as well as on the economic performance of those cities. London desperately needs that sort of spending on such schemes. That is why I am an enthusiastic member of the all-party group on the Thameslink route, and I hope that the scheme will go ahead in its entirety."
02/02/2010,Commons,65,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,"I shall try to be as brief as possible to enable other honourable Members to speak. First, I congratulate my honourable Friend and my genuine friend the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall) on securing the debate and on what he has said today. Like him, I am a massive enthusiast of railways in general, and the modernisation of Thameslink in particular. I have thousands of constituents who, like my honourable Friend, travel every day by Thameslink. I have been a commuter on that line for the past 41 years, and I still use it every day. Therefore, I know the problem. Some years ago, I think I had an influence in persuading Ministers to build the box station at St. Pancras International, pointing out that if we had not done that, Eurostar services would have been seriously damaged. The line is a serious provider of passengers straight on to Eurostar. Because of that box station, those of us who live on the Thameslink line can pop over to Paris at short notice something I have done myself."
02/02/2010,Commons,66,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,"The improvement of the through-London service is excellent and vital, and I am happy about the concept. However, I must raise some concerns about the engineering and the technology. Friends of mine in the industry engineers in particular have said that there are serious problems. From time to time I read magazines such as Modern Railways, which give me a bit of insight into how things work. Trying to get 24 trains through that middle section is a major problem. That is a large number of trains, and it is not a simple through-route. There are two routes feeding in from GNER and from the midlands to King s Cross and St. Pancras. Sequencing all those trains and ensuring that they get through on time and can stop, offload, onload and move on will be a serious problem."
02/02/2010,Commons,67,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,"To an extent, that has been partly recognised, but there are other problems. That section of the line has some of the steepest gradients in the country. Will we have sufficient power to allow trains to get through those gradients sufficiently quickly? I understand that most trains have eight driven axles for a four-car unit, but we may need to increase the number of driven axles which increases costs to ensure that trains can cope with those gradients at sufficient speed to get through the system."
02/02/2010,Commons,68,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,"The switchover from overhead AC power lines to third-rail DC drive also takes time. I see that every day at Farringdon. That is another potential problem that can slow trains down. As I have said, that has been recognised to an extent. There is some suggestion of having automatic train operation between Kentish Town and Blackfriars. Automatic train operation has not been tried in Britain on a mainline service. It is used on the Victoria line, but not elsewhere. It has not been tried, and certainly not on a complex system such as Thameslink, where there are two railway lines coming into one at St. Pancras. Automatic operation in a dry, straight tunnel with no complications is one thing, but where there are problems with weather such as wet track, leaf fall or frost if some of the track is exposed, something called defensive braking will be required in the automatic operation to ensure that the trains do not slip and that they get through. Again, that could cause delay and would certainly add enormous costs."
02/02/2010,Commons,69,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,"I therefore suggest to my honourable Friend the Minister that what we need at this stage, before things go wrong and we say,  Oh dear, we cannot deal with this; there is a problem, is a thorough review of all the engineering problems in the system by BR-trained engineers in all the specialisms required, not by project managers and people who have little experience in railways, and without pressure from Network Rail or contractors to gloss over details. We must get this right, and I ask the Minister to secure a thorough engineering review by an independent group of engineers with all the necessary skills to ensure that we do not make mistakes and that we get it right."
02/02/2010,Commons,70,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"I hope to be able to advise my honourable Friend. This might not negate the need for the engineering review that he is calling for, but I understand that the intention is to have a section of track available to test the automatic train operation technologies well in advance of any intention to implement them."
02/02/2010,Commons,71,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,"I thank my honourable Friend for that. It is welcome. One other point is that there are signalling and electrical power problems. Already there have been line-side fires in the tunnel between Farringdon and City Thameslink. That, I understand, is caused by arcing from the third rails, because the delivery for electricity to those tracks is at one end of that section of track rather than, typically, in the centre, which means that the voltages must be higher to drive the current longer distances. Those points have been made to me by engineers who understand these things I have some technical knowledge myself and they are serious matters. If one line-side fire stops 24 trains an hour, a two-hour blockage stops 48 trains, and if 48 12-car trains are suddenly stopped, we have a real crisis. We cannot afford to have things going wrong on a line of this importance any more than we could afford serious problems on some of the major underground routes. At least sometimes there are alternatives to underground routes. There may not be alternatives for Thameslink. I have raised those matters with the Minister to ensure that he is aware that there are potential engineering problems and to ask him to investigate the possibility of having a thorough review."
02/02/2010,Commons,72,Simon Hughes,North Southwark and Bermondsey,LD,"I am grateful to the honourable Member for Bedford for the opportunity provided by the debate. I shall make just a short contribution, but I am one of those colleagues who have been involved in all the discussions about Thameslink for many years. I just gently say that of course the project used to be called Thameslink 2000; we have slipped a little in relation to its delivery."
02/02/2010,Commons,73,Simon Hughes,North Southwark and Bermondsey,LD,"I want to make several points. One is that at the fantastic new St. Pancras station I agree about how wonderful it is there is still, for both British and international travellers, some confusion about which lines run from where. Obviously, the Eurostar is clearly signed, but it is not entirely clear, from all entrances, where people should catch other services from, and that information can be crucial to people s timetabling and their ability to get from ticket office to train and from one line to another. Although that is not directly a Thameslink responsibility, it is relevant to users of Thameslink and interconnecting passengers, so I make a plea that Thameslink use its good influence, and that Network Rail and those who manage St. Pancras also act, to ensure that there is a clear set of signs so that people can be clear about which trains leave from the upper level, about which trains leave from the lower level at the back and about Eurostar."
02/02/2010,Commons,74,"Secondly, in relation to London Bridge, which is the biggest issue affecting my constituency and has been referred to already by the honourable Members for Bedford and for Orpington","Mr. Horam , I shall not refight the battle that we fought. We argued that there was an alternative route that might have been a good one either the Herne Hill route or a new route by a new bridge over the Thames. That could have avoided the problem of having to demolish many listed buildings at London Bridge. However, it is important that as part of the new project London Bridge station is reconstructed. I think that it is still the station in London that has most passengers through it every day. It is phenomenally busy and congested, and many of the trains into and out of it are, as the honourable Member for Orpington rightly pointed out, phenomenally busy and congested. That can be very unpleasant and, indeed, dangerous.",NA,"The local community that lives around the station will have to pay the price of all the works, which have started on the site next door. The tallest building in London is being built there at the moment. I am referring to the Shard of Glass at London Bridge. The community is signed up to that project, on the understanding that phase 1 will be completed before 2012. There will be a pause during the Olympic period and there will be a second phase after that. I absolutely endorse the plea from the honourable Member for Bedford and others that we do not see the project grind to a halt after phase 1. I am very grateful for the commitment by my honourable Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) that makes clear the importance that we attach to the completion after 2012 of the rest of the project."
02/02/2010,Commons,75,"Secondly, in relation to London Bridge, which is the biggest issue affecting my constituency and has been referred to already by the honourable Members for Bedford and for Orpington","Mr. Horam , I shall not refight the battle that we fought.

A further part of the work is on the line out of London Bridge station, as part of the works in Bermondsey. Again, that is entirely supported by me and the community. We just want to signal and register our support for that."
02/02/2010,Commons,76,"Secondly, in relation to London Bridge, which is the biggest issue affecting my constituency and has been referred to already by the honourable Members for Bedford and for Orpington","Mr. Horam , I shall not refight the battle that we fought.

That is being sold and presented very well by Thameslink, which has put posters across Blackfriars bridge making it clear that it will be the first cross-river railway station either ever or for a very long time I cannot remember, although I ought to. That in itself is exciting. It is frustrating that we did not win the battle all those years ago when the Jubilee line alignment was determined, meaning that there could have been an interconnection at the station, on the south side, so people would not have had to come out of the station but could have linked to another. The local community is paying a small price at the moment in terms of pedestrian disruption, but the community negotiated with Thameslink and Network Rail; it is understanding of that. As long as the timetable is kept to, it is entirely understood and appreciated."
02/02/2010,Commons,77,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,I assure the honourable Gentleman that I tried to visit Tate Modern over the Christmas period and I know exactly what he is talking about.
02/02/2010,Commons,78,Simon Hughes,North Southwark and Bermondsey,LD,"I am pleased to hear that. The Minister is very welcome to visit my constituency socially, as well as for political reasons, at any time. As someone who, wearing another hat, chairs the Mayor of London s Thames festival, which now has just short of 1 million visitors in September every year, I know that ensuring that the pedestrian flows along the riverbank work well through all the building work is important to ensure that there is no inconvenience. Again, we shall need to ensure, as Blackfriars station comes on stream on the south side, that we have the most effective signs and intercommunication, so that people understand the great benefit of getting off at Southwark underground station on the Jubilee line and making that connection. We need to ensure that that works well, even though it is a few hundred yards out in the open."
02/02/2010,Commons,79,Simon Hughes,North Southwark and Bermondsey,LD,"Fifthly, I turn to signalling, a point that was made by the honourable Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins). I was keen, when the opportunity arose again in the time of the Conservative Government, to ensure that we had an extension to the London underground. In the end, it was not the initially preferred solution, but the Jubilee line extension was certainly welcome. We had to fight to ensure that it was not just a fast line that went from London Bridge and Waterloo straight to Canary Wharf, and we managed to win the battle to get stations in Southwark and Bermondsey, which are also welcome. Ten years on, we are celebrating 10 years of the extension, but there are many closures for re-signalling work. That will obviously produce a good outcome but, although I am no engineer, I want to flag up the importance of ensuring that we get the signalling work in place such that there will be a longer period through which it will be expected to work without disruption, because little is worse than having a fantastic new line that then needs upgrades and on which there are weekend closures and other disruption fairly shortly after it has been put in place."
02/02/2010,Commons,80,Simon Hughes,North Southwark and Bermondsey,LD,"My last point is one that I have made to Network Rail and to Thameslink. At the moment, there cannot be a seamless connection, because of the works done, from the south to the north, particularly at weekends or at night, when people might be able to get to London Bridge but then find that there is no service that goes all the way through, and they have to reconnect at St. Pancras. It is therefore very important to ensure, again, that the information is clear in advance. Having once gone with others to catch a plane, I know that if a service is not there when people think that it will be, they will miss not just their train, but their flight from Luton, Gatwick or elsewhere. Can we therefore make sure that there is really good advance information all the year round at all stations along the line about what happens at weekends and at nights when there is no connection? People will then know exactly what to do and what the quickest connecting route is. Can we also ensure that all the other transport operators work together with Thameslink and Network Rail?"
02/02/2010,Commons,81,Laura Moffatt,Crawley,Lab,"I congratulate my honourable Friend the Member for Bedford on raising this important issue. As a member of the all-party group, I have learned exactly what the Thameslink programme will mean for our constituents, which is why we have put in extra work looking at improvements, watching out for the things that will affect our constituents and trying to intervene through debates such as this. It is a pleasure to be here, although I shall take only a couple of minutes to speak, so that all honourable Members get an opportunity to contribute to this important debate."
02/02/2010,Commons,82,Laura Moffatt,Crawley,Lab,"We are here because of our constituents. The lives of some have been disrupted by what, in many ways, is the First Capital Connect debacle, and people have had a difficult time. It is hard for us as Members of Parliament fighting for improvements to Thameslink to see our constituents experience that totally avoidable disruption to their lives; all those of us who travel into London every day understand exactly what they are going through. Having their rail journeys disrupted is truly upsetting and can make the rest of their day a miserable experience. That is the last thing that we want."
02/02/2010,Commons,83,Laura Moffatt,Crawley,Lab,"We understand what the  5.5 billion of improvements will mean. Those of us who were lucky enough to take a cab to look at the magnificent improvements around King s Cross and at the amazing work that is going on there were immensely proud to see that we can have first-class rail travel services. As I said, we are all here for our constituents, and although we have a firm eye on the Olympics and on the important improvements that can be put in place for people travelling into London certainly from Gatwick airport that is a bit of a side issue; we are talking about our constituents and ensuring that their journey times are good."
02/02/2010,Commons,84,Laura Moffatt,Crawley,Lab,"Of course, we also want to ensure that our constituents  journeys are safe. Like my honourable Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), I have been concerned about the loss of engineering jobs at Network Rail. That is because we have been listening to people who know and love the railways and who understand what that loss might mean. I am delighted that the Office of the Rail Regulator is now keeping a close eye on what Network Rail is up to, to ensure that my constituents are safe."
02/02/2010,Commons,85,Laura Moffatt,Crawley,Lab,"We need to know that the Thameslink upgrade programme will be completed in its entirety; if it were not, that would be a travesty of justice. We have sold the whole programme to our constituents on the basis that their lives as members of the travelling public will be massively improved soon, in five years. That is what people deserve. We know the prosperity that the changes will bring. When we were at school, we understood how important the Stockton-to-Darlington railway was and what improvements and prosperity it brought to communities. In the same way, we know that the current programme will improve the way in which people live and work in the south-east. That is why we are so desperate to see the programme finished in its entirety."
02/02/2010,Commons,86,Laura Moffatt,Crawley,Lab,"I completely understand that those who have to make a decision about the two remaining competitors for the Thameslink rolling stock project must be extremely careful, but I do not have to be. I should say that I am convinced that the Bombardier project needs to be selected. I went on an Industry and Parliamentary Trust transport group visit to look at the trains being constructed in Derby, and I was utterly blown away by the professionalism that I saw. As we know, there have been difficulties, but those involved have held their hands up, and we can move on. I am firmly putting my flag up for the Bombardier team and I hope that it gets the project."
02/02/2010,Commons,87,Laura Moffatt,Crawley,Lab,"The Thameslink programme is enormous. If we go to the Network Rail and Thameslink programme website, it is hard even to conceive of the number of projects that are running at one time it is tremendous. People should look at the magnificent depot proposed for Three Bridges, which is the central station in my constituency. The project will provide 300 new jobs, but I need the Minister to reassure me that it will go ahead so that we can look forward to restoring Three Bridges and making it the major hub that it was many years ago. When I was a small baby, my parents moved to Crawley New Town, and Three Bridges was at the heart of the train service. We look forward to those days returning. The Minister has been fantastic on train issues, and I ask him to reassure us that the Thameslink programme is safe in the Government s hands."
02/02/2010,Commons,88,Laura Moffatt,Crawley,Lab,"As the honourable Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) asked, can we ensure that information is there for passengers and gives them the opportunity to know when there will be disruptions? Major improvements mean disruption for our constituents, so we need to let them know what is going on. I have been impressed by the information that has been put in place so far, but that needs to continue. Let us see the Thameslink programme benefit all our constituencies, so that we can be proud of it for many years to come."
02/02/2010,Commons,89,Mr. Bob Laxton,"Derby, North",Lab,"I congratulate my honourable Friend the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall) on securing this debate. I acknowledge no, more than acknowledge the comments made by my honourable Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) about awarding the contract to Bombardier, which is a UK-based company."
02/02/2010,Commons,90,Mr. Bob Laxton,"Derby, North",Lab,"It is clear from the debate that some honourable Members in the Chamber have far more knowledge about the ins and outs and the nuts and bolts of the Thameslink route than I do. My expertise, if I have any, comes from my home city of Derby. I want briefly to reinforce the points that I made in my intervention."
02/02/2010,Commons,91,Mr. Bob Laxton,"Derby, North",Lab,"Although Bombardier in Derby has a reasonable amount of work, it will be disastrous if the company fails to win the Thameslink contract, because it would effectively run out of work over the next couple of years. As a result of what is happening in the world economy, the UK wants to rebuild its industry, to get people back into work and to sustain them in work."
02/02/2010,Commons,92,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,"I absolutely support my honourable Friend s point that the contract should go to Bombardier. However, this is about not only Bombardier, but British manufacturing and the loss of skills. If we ever lost that manufacturing capacity, it would be almost impossible to recreate, and our balance of trade deficit, which is already massive, would become even larger. We would be on the way to ceasing to be a manufacturing nation, with seriously damaging consequences for the long term."
02/02/2010,Commons,93,Mr. Bob Laxton,"Derby, North",Lab,I agree entirely. That is why it is vital that a UK-based company should win the work.
02/02/2010,Commons,94,Mr. Bob Laxton,"Derby, North",Lab,"I am on record as being somewhat critical that is perhaps an understatement of some of the ordering processes at the Department for Transport. The most recent example involved the inter-city express contract being awarded to Agility Trains, a consortium that includes Hitachi of Japan. The contract was said to have the potential to create 12,500 jobs, but as we will find out in due course, there will be no manufacturing jobs or supply-chain jobs for UK plc. There might be a few hundred jobs maintaining the trains, although that would apply whoever won the contract, because maintenance depots would have to be established. I am particularly critical about that."
02/02/2010,Commons,95,Mr. Bob Laxton,"Derby, North",Lab,"I have a crucial question for the Minister: can he give us a clear indication of when the contract will be awarded? Derby is a centre of rail expertise. Perhaps it is also, to a degree, a centre of rail gossip; much of that is accurate, and the word out on the bush telegraph is that a decision to award the contract is likely to be made at the end of March. Can the Minister confirm that that is so, and, if not, will he make it clear when the decision will be taken although, of course, a period of negotiation is likely beyond that time?"
02/02/2010,Commons,96,Mr. Bob Laxton,"Derby, North",Lab,"I am interested in hearing the other speeches in the debate, and particularly the Minister s answer to my question. I also look forward to hearing his answers to the pertinent questions raised by my honourable Friend the Member for Bedford."
02/02/2010,Commons,97,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"I congratulate the honourable Member for Bedford on his speech and on the work that he has done with the all-party Thameslink route group. I checked this morning, and I am a member of that group; I am happy to be so."
02/02/2010,Commons,98,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"My remarks are predominantly about the long-term plans not too long term, I hope for the improvement of the railway line, but I want first to make one or two brief comments about First Capital Connect, because that is relevant to the Thameslink project."
02/02/2010,Commons,99,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"It is clear that First Capital Connect has let passengers down badly. There are serious issues about the rostering of train drivers and whether they will be expected to work overtime as a matter of course, which effectively creates vulnerability to working to rule. There is also the serious issue of whether more money should have been spent on training more train drivers. That is relevant to the parliamentary question, tabled by the honourable Member for Bedford, about the number of extra train drivers who would be required to operate the enhanced Thameslink service."
02/02/2010,Commons,100,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"The Minister gave a figure of 80, but I should be interested to know whether that assumes the existing working pattern for drivers or, as I hope, a more sensible approach to working pattern and arrangements for drivers. In passing, I should say that the consequences for the south of London have not perhaps been as bad as those for the north of London, partly because Southern has coped well with the unexpected problems that it has had to deal with because of First Capital Connect s inadequacies. The Minister will be aware that there is a considerable movement under way in the House in favour of First Capital Connect s having its franchise removed. I refer to the early-day motion tabled by my honourable Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), which many honourable Members of all parties, I think have signed."
02/02/2010,Commons,101,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"Because the debate relates to the timetable and the 2015 dates and stages set out by the honourable Member for Bedford, it would be useful if the Minister said something about his intentions for the First Capital Connect franchise. It can end naturally in 2012, or be extended to 2015. It is, I think, clear that the Minister and the Department wanted to extend it to 2015, because of the coterminosity with the end of the Southern franchise, which was clearly in their minds."
02/02/2010,Commons,102,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"Many of my constituents, and those of other honourable Members present for the debate, might be unhappy to be told that there will be another five years with that company in charge, given how abysmally it has performed so far. A third option, of course, would be for the Minister to remove the franchise early, as happened with the Great North Eastern Railway and National Express. Some early clarification on that point would be helpful. If the Minister cannot give an answer today, can he say at what point the Government intend to make a statement of intention about the First Capital Connect franchise?"
02/02/2010,Commons,103,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,"The honourable Gentleman may have heard my question, following one from the honourable Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), in Transport questions last week. The Minister was definitely open-minded about the future of the franchise. Indeed, the possibility of taking it back into public ownership was not ruled out."
02/02/2010,Commons,104,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"I heard that he was open-minded, but also that he was uncertain about the conclusion, which is why I thought it might be prudent to push the matter again today."
02/02/2010,Commons,105,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"The Thameslink programme is clearly a major investment, with major public benefit not just for rail passengers but for the economy of the areas that the route serves. It has had a long gestation. Rail schemes that were formulated decades ago seem to have taken an enormous amount of time to proceed. My honourable Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) mentioned the fact that Thameslink used to be called Thameslink 2000, and that it is now 2010 but we still do not have it."
02/02/2010,Commons,106,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"It is important for all Members of Parliament to accept that we cannot stop-start rail projects of such magnitude. They need long-term planning and commitment, and stop-starting costs money in cancellation fees. It is also, frankly, an incoherent way to run public policy on railways. For those reasons, and because there has already been delay, and given the difficult financial situation to which the honourable Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam) referred, which doubtless will continue under the next Government of whatever colour, it is important not to take short-term decisions that damage the country in the medium and long terms and are financially incompetent. It is clear to me that there should be no reduction in the Thameslink programme as planned. That is the position that my party formally adopts, and will adopt for the general election. It would be helpful today, for future planning, if the Conservative spokesman and the Minister were to give similar assurances."
02/02/2010,Commons,107,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"There is no point in my repeating the specific questions put by the honourable Members for Bedford and for Luton, North, but they were germane to the nuts and bolts of the scheme and I hope that the Minister will respond in detail. If he cannot, I hope that perhaps, as a courtesy, he will write to all the Members who have attended the debate, with specific answers to those important questions."
02/02/2010,Commons,108,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"The question of the sliding doors was raised, and I confirm that it is a serious issue. It is important at the present design stage that that matter should be properly addressed. Either the doors should be changed or a mechanism should be introduced to prevent the sort of problem that occurred with the sliding doors of the 319s which, by the way, are regarded in the trade as dustbin trains. That is the current terminology. I see that we are to get some of them cascaded down to the Brighton-to-Eastbourne route by the Government. Perhaps the honourable Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper), who is no longer in the Chamber, may take an interest in that matter."
02/02/2010,Commons,109,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"The honourable Member for Orpington spoke about the funding of future transport schemes. It is important to make it plain at this point that, notwithstanding the economic difficulties that the country faces, there is a sensible economic case perhaps even more so because of the economic circumstances for investing in jobs, and particularly those that bring an environmental benefit, in the light of the challenge of climate change. That is why my party will make the creation of green jobs a priority at the general election."
02/02/2010,Commons,110,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"Railway investment fits firmly into that scenario. For that reason, I should be interested in the Minister s confirmation of plans for the introduction of new rolling stock. We have been promised 1,300 new carriages on many occasions. A bit like Billy Bunter s postal order, they never quite turn up; we are hoping that one day they will. Perhaps the Minister can give an answer about that and deal with the inconsistency in the timing, between 2012 and 2013, that has been mentioned in relation to Thameslink."
02/02/2010,Commons,111,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"I assure the honourable Gentleman that some of the high-level output specification additional rolling stock is already in service, and that I launched the Essex Commuter as a contribution to that only last month."
02/02/2010,Commons,112,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"I have no doubt that some are in service, but that is not quite the point that I was making, which was about the delivery date and in-service delivery date for the 1,300 vehicles that were referred to. That matter is difficult to pin down a bit like jelly."
02/02/2010,Commons,113,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"An important point that arises from the debate so far relates to through-London services. A couple of honourable Members have touched on that important issue. If we are to have major capacity constraints, as we do on the network all round London and it is not easy to see a solution in terms of creating extra capacity at the termini in London it is important to have efficient, fully working through-London services. Such services, with termination points either side of London, allow far more trains to be used than services that terminate at a London terminus, whose turn-around times mean that a much more limited number of trains can be got in and out of the station. Through-London services are important for enhancement of capacity, which is why the points made by the honourable Member for Luton, North, in particular, are important."
02/02/2010,Commons,114,Kelvin Hopkins,"Luton, North",Lab,"Two of my constituents work in south London, but only because they can travel through London on Thameslink. These services enhance job opportunities for millions of people."
02/02/2010,Commons,115,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"They do, and the opening of the Snow Hill tunnel has been a transformation. We ought to build on such changes."
02/02/2010,Commons,116,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"The Thameslink programme is crucial to London, as is the Crossrail project. It is important to have consistency and predictability. It would be a service to our constituents if all parties were able to commit to the project and remove any uncertainty."
02/02/2010,Commons,117,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"It is a great pleasure, Lady Winterton, to see you in the Chair. I congratulate the honourable Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall) on securing this debate."
02/02/2010,Commons,118,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"I shall not touch upon First Capital Connect rail services today, because we have an hour-and-a-half debate on the subject tomorrow. I shall target my remarks particularly on key output 2 of the Thameslink project, and later I shall ask some questions of the Minister."
02/02/2010,Commons,119,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"The honourable Member for Bedford was right to state that it is a long-running saga. The project was formerly called Thameslink 2000 some thought that it should have been Thameslink never and it is now the Thameslink programme. If it is to happen, it will be delivered by 2015."
02/02/2010,Commons,120,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"A number of interesting and thoughtful contributions have been made to the debate, and I shall refer to them during my remarks. The Thameslink programme is split into two key delivery phases key outputs 1 and 2 and as the honourable Member for Bedford so correctly said, the preparatory phase was delivered in 2009. Key output 1 includes the building of a new station at Blackfriars, the transformation of Farringdon and a number of platform-lengthening schemes."
02/02/2010,Commons,121,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"One of the pleasures of contributing to such debates is that I speak not only for my party but for my constituents, who are affected by Thameslink. One matter that has been referred to a number of times is the ability to allow through traffic. On a parochial basis, speaking on behalf of my constituents, I have a question for the Minister. The Secretary of State kindly promised that when the draft timetable was published he would consider whether the Sutton loop could allow through trains to St. Pancras, rather than every train having to stop at Blackfriars. Will the Minister confirm that my constituents can still rely on that promise?"
02/02/2010,Commons,122,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"I assure the honourable Gentleman that the development of the detailed timetable is a task for the future, and we will consider the matter carefully."
02/02/2010,Commons,123,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,I shall keep that promise tucked away.
02/02/2010,Commons,124,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"Key output 2 is crucial. A number of Members have referred to it, and questions have touched on the subject. This debate gives the Minister the chance to confirm or deny many things. The main part of key output 2, as we heard, is the rebuilding of track, the rebuilding of London Bridge station and the letting of the rolling-stock contracts. In total, the latter would facilitate the running of 24 12-car trains an hour through the core section. The programme will include signal alterations, new platforms and the complete reorganisation of the underground station. It is all very exciting."
02/02/2010,Commons,125,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"Today s debate is welcome because, as the honourable Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) said, the railway industry is one of rumour and bush telegraph; it has also given rise to a huge number of railway magazines and learned journals. I have a number of questions for the Minister; he might wish to answer them or at least clarify the Government s position."
02/02/2010,Commons,126,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"The works on the track and at London Bridge station are key parts of the Mayor of London s strategy, and they support the entire economic and transport capacity of London and the south-east. However, it is widely rumoured, not only in the article referred to earlier, that the rebuild and the track works are considerably over the budget set by Network Rail and the Government. The cost evaluation has been undertaken through Network Rail s guide to railway investment projects GRIP process."
02/02/2010,Commons,127,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"Will the Minister tell us whether GRIP stage 3 is now complete? Will he say what is the scale of the overruns against the original allocated budget for key output 2 is it  500 million,  600 million,  700 million or  800 million? Will he confirm that Network Rail s proposed solution is not to bring the costs back into line but to de-scope the project? Will he confirm that the Mayor of London has written to the Secretary of State, pointing out what many Members have said that only if full output is achieved for the allocated budget will we get the real benefits of the project, otherwise the viability of the scheme will be undermined?"
02/02/2010,Commons,128,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"It is widely anticipated I am sure that the Minister will be aware of this that Network Rail will seek to change the plans for London Bridge construction. In the original output 6A, the specification proposal was for nine through platforms rather than six. I understand that the sponsor team has iterated that specification and reiterated it to Network Rail. Network Rail has not come up with a plan to deliver nine through platforms within the allocated budget and with acceptable passenger congestion. Will the Minister confirm that Network Rail does not propose building nine through platforms? Will he give an estimation of the impact on through trains, with trains not being able to stop at London Bridge, if we do not get the full scaling of the project?"
02/02/2010,Commons,129,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"There is a major design issue here. If those through platforms are not delivered, I understand that a redesign of the entry and exit points to the underground station will be necessary, which will involve a renewed planning application. Will the Minister confirm that that is so, and if so what will be the overall delay to the scheme? Will he confirm that it is the Government s intention to ask Network Rail to respond to option 6A for London Bridge with a realistic operational and cost proposition? If the Government do not intend to do so now, exactly when will it happen? We heard earlier about the Bedford depot, but will the Minister deal with the rumour that the Hornsey depot, which is crucial to the stabling of trains, is also under threat from local planning requirements, and that the local council is likely to refuse that application?"
02/02/2010,Commons,130,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"Thameslink, through its procurement process, is supposed to deliver 24 12-car trains an hour. Rumours are circulating on the bush telegraph that the number is to be reduced from 24 to 20. Will the Minister tell us that that will not happen? Will he confirm that preferred bidders have been asked to retender on the basis of 20 trains, or have the Government given no advice on that? Will he say whether he has taken consequential legal advice on the Thameslink procurement contract? If there is to be a de-scoping of the contract for the Thameslink programme, will the whole contract have to be retendered? Many of us have asked when the Minister will be making the Thameslink procurement announcement. Can we expect it at the end of March? If so, can we take it that 24 trains an hour will be delivered?"
02/02/2010,Commons,131,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"While on the subject of procurement, the Minister did not answer the question about the 1,300 vehicles nor did I expect him to. However, I wish to test him on a couple of other procurement matters. Will he confirm that the financial bidder for Agility Trains has withdrawn, and that the Government are retendering that contract to rolling-stock leasing companies? Will he also confirm that the Government do not intend to buy the extra 42 Pendolinos to allow the west coast main line to run 11-car trains rather than nine-car trains?"
02/02/2010,Commons,132,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"Finally, on the subject of signalling, will the Minister confirm whether Network Rail proposes abandoning automatic train operation and giving no consideration to ERTMS, the European rail traffic management system, but have decided instead to revert entirely to manual signalling? What implications will that have for the effectiveness of the delivery of the Thameslink programme?"
02/02/2010,Commons,133,Norman Baker,Lewes,LD,"As the honourable Gentleman has asked the Minister many questions, may I ask him one? If there is a Conservative Government after the next election, will he ring-fence the project so that it will proceed, or will the shadow Chancellor consider it for a potential cut?"
02/02/2010,Commons,134,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,I need the answers to all my questions before I can make a reasonable judgment on that question.
02/02/2010,Commons,135,Stephen Hammond,Wimbledon,Con,"I have asked the Minister a number of detailed and specific questions that are germane to this project and to people being able to decide how the project will proceed. If the Minister cannot answer all those questions now, will he agree to provide written answers to them?"
02/02/2010,Commons,136,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"I congratulate my honourable Friend the Member for Bedford on securing this debate. As  chair of the all-party group on the Thameslink route, he obviously has a particular interest in the subject. I will try not to be diverted by questions on the recent performance of First Capital Connect, because there will be an hour-and-a-half debate on the subject tomorrow."
02/02/2010,Commons,137,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"I welcome the opportunity to outline the good progress that is being made in delivering this vital programme that will transform the travel experience for many thousands of commuters in London and the south-east of England. The Thameslink programme is one of the Government s key transport priorities announced in the 2007 White Paper,  Delivering a Sustainable Railway ù."
02/02/2010,Commons,138,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"The programme is a crucial part of our strategy to tackle chronic overcrowding on commuter routes the honourable Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam) illustrated that well in his contribution to provide capacity for future growth; and to deliver long-term benefits for passengers, the environment and the UK economy. Such a strategy is being achieved through a comprehensive modernisation programme, which will provide new and longer trains, upgraded stations and more frequent services through the centre of London, with up to 24 trains per hour in both directions."
02/02/2010,Commons,139,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"The Thameslink programme aims to reduce crowding on current Thameslink and other commuter services; and to provide for the introduction of new cross-London services, so improving public transport accessibility in south-east England. For example, it will be possible to take a train direct from Cambridge to Gatwick airport, which must be good news for my honourable Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt). The programme will also reduce the need for interchange between mainline and London underground train services and therefore reduce overcrowding on the underground, especially the Victoria and Piccadilly lines and the City branch of the Northern line. It will improve the reliability of train services operating through the core route section between London Bridge or Elephant and Castle and St. Pancras."
02/02/2010,Commons,140,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"The programme itself delivers very substantial transport and revenue benefits in the region of  10 billion over the life of the programme. Those benefits are primarily due to the increased capacity and frequency that the scheme provides into and through central London, which, I think, answers the question of the honourable Member for Lewes (Norman Baker). The strength of the business case is such that everyone should support the scheme."
02/02/2010,Commons,141,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"To deliver such benefits, major project works will be required in central London, which some have described as the equivalent of doing open-heart surgery on the centre of London. The most significant works will be at London Bridge station, where it will be necessary to widen the railway viaduct at the western side of the station at Borough, which the honourable Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) mentioned."
02/02/2010,Commons,142,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"Blackfriars and Farringdon stations are also being rebuilt and platforms are being extended at a large number of stations, both north and south of London, to enable them to be used by 12-carriage trains. Moreover, a new state of the art fleet of trains is being procured to replace the existing fleet and provide the capacity for the 24 trains per hour service. They will be the next-generation electric commuter trains and will be fully accessible for mobility-impaired users. I note the comments of my honourable Friend the Member for Bedford about freezing conditions. The new trains must be able to cope with 24 trains per hour through the core. They will have high specifications, which will deal with issues such as freezing conditions."
02/02/2010,Commons,143,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"I am pleased to say that significant progress has been made in delivering the programme, which has been split into three distinct phases. Key output 0 was an enabling phase and saw the introduction, on 22 March 2009, of a new Thameslink train timetable requiring dual voltage trains. My honourable Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) referred to the challenges of operating with the dual voltage train regime."
02/02/2010,Commons,144,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"Key output 1 involves the construction of Blackfriars and Farringdon stations, which, together with platform extensions along the midland main line, will allow longer 12-carriage trains to operate from Bedford to destinations south of London, and there will be up to 15 trains per hour through central London. The infrastructure capability from such works is due to be available at the end of 2011."
02/02/2010,Commons,145,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"Key output 2 provides the full functionality of the Thameslink programme. There will be 24 trains per hour through the central core section, which will be achieved through the resignalling and reconstruction of London Bridge station and its approaches together with a new fleet of approximately 1,200 vehicles. That stage is scheduled to be completed from December 2016."
02/02/2010,Commons,146,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,The first enabling phase of the programme was successfully introduced on 22 March 2009. It involved the closure of the bay platforms at Blackfriars and the closure of the Thameslink Moorgate branch. That was achieved by linking the north and south services together and running them through the core central London Thameslink route using additional new dual voltage trains.
02/02/2010,Commons,147,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"The key output 0 element of the programme was delivered on time and on budget despite supply difficulties with the new trains. Much of the success can be attributed to excellent co-operation across the rail industry, where temporary measures were put in place to supply dual voltage trains to mitigate supply problems."
02/02/2010,Commons,148,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,I am pleased to report that all the required 23 dual voltage trains have been delivered and are now in service with First Capital Connect. All temporary rolling-stock mitigation measures that were in place since March 2009 have now been withdrawn.
02/02/2010,Commons,149,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"The objective of key output 1 is to deliver interim benefits before the full scheme key output 2 is completed. By December 2011, key output 1 will deliver the infrastructure capability to operate longer 12-carriage trains from the midland main line through the central core route and beyond. The scope of the works includes lengthening platforms on the midland main line to 12-carriage trains; major rebuilding of Farringdon station, including new ticket halls and interchange with Crossrail; the total reconstruction of Blackfriars station, including a new underground station, new platforms spanning the Thames on a widened bridge and an additional south bank ticket hall; and enhancements to rail systems involving signalling, power, communications and track, which should address some of the concerns of my honourable Friend the Member for Luton, North."
02/02/2010,Commons,150,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"Network Rail made excellent progress over the Christmas period in completing critical works at Blackfriars where a new bridge was installed, at Farringdon where work to enable the integrated Crossrail ticket hall began, and at St. Pancras where new signalling was installed. Network Rail forecasts that the works for key output 1 can be completed to budget and on time. The 12-carriage infrastructure capability will be delivered by the baseline target date of December 2011. Such an improvement will provide significant crowding relief benefits to commuters on the midland main line and will be the first significant step change in capacity arising from the Thameslink programme."
02/02/2010,Commons,151,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"The full functionality of the Thameslink programme, which is 24 trains per hour through the central London core section, is achieved through the resignalling and reconstruction of London Bridge station and its approaches, together with a new fleet of approximately 1,200 carriages, referred to as key output 2, and is scheduled to be delivered from 2016."
02/02/2010,Commons,152,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"Key elements of scope include: major reconstruction of London Bridge station and approaches, including a new flyover at Bermondsey and a new viaduct at Borough market; a link to the east coast main line, north of St. Pancras Thameslink station; 12-carriage length platforms on outer areas south of London and on the east coast main line to Cambridge; enhancements to signalling, communications, power and track; stabling and depot connections; and automatic train operation through the core central London section. That answers the concern of the honourable Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) about the future of ATO."
02/02/2010,Commons,153,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"In relation to depots, let me tell my honourable Friend the Member for Bedford that the Bedford depot will be kept in the short term to service the residual class 319 fleet until the full fleet of new trains arrive. In the long term, it will be kept for stabling for the eight-car element of the fleet of new trains."
02/02/2010,Commons,154,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"Let me tell my honourable Friend the Member for Crawley that the project at Three Bridges is progressing well, and that no problems have been identified there."
02/02/2010,Commons,155,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"Work has already started on widening the viaduct at Borough to the west of London Bridge station. That section of track is one of the most congested in the country, and is currently the key bottleneck for existing Thameslink services. For the remainder of key output 2, planning and optioneering are progressing very well, with final options being examined in detail by Network Rail. Significantly, a major upgrade is due to start at London Bridge station in the autumn."
02/02/2010,Commons,156,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"The honourable Member for Wimbledon asked me innumerable questions, which I may have to write to him about."
02/02/2010,Commons,157,Patrick Hall,Bedford,Lab,Will the Minister take the opportunity to make it crystal clear that he and the Government are committed to completing the Thameslink programme?
02/02/2010,Commons,158,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,"My honourable Friend stopped me from getting to my next paragraph. I wanted to say that the construction works at London Bridge are due to start in the autumn of 2012, following the closure of the Olympic games."
02/02/2010,Commons,159,Chris Mole,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Lab,The Department for Transport is closely monitoring the costs of the Thameslink programme. We and our industry partners are both committed to and totally focused on delivering the full 24 trains per hour output to an affordable budget. Costs are constantly challenged across the entire programme to ensure that it remains affordable.
02/12/2010,Commons,1,Gavin Shuker,Luton South,Lab/Co-op,What steps he is taking to ensure that the Thameslink project is completed on time.
02/12/2010,Commons,2,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"As I confirmed on 25 November, the Thameslink programme will go ahead in full. To improve delivery confidence, we will defer completion of the full programme, allowing 24 trains per hour in each direction, until 2018. This will reduce both cost and risk, particularly in respect of the reconstruction of London Bridge station. Passengers will start to see benefits from December 2011, when works at Blackfriars will be completed, and some 12-car trains will start to run from Bedford through to Brighton."
02/12/2010,Commons,3,Gavin Shuker,Luton South,Lab/Co-op,"As the Secretary of State will be aware, many of my constituents are struggling to get into work this morning on the existing rolling stock. New rolling stock is therefore vital as part of the Thameslink upgrade. Would he be willing to share the time scales for delivery of such rolling stock and place the information on record in the House?"
02/12/2010,Commons,4,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"It is expected that the new Thameslink rolling stock 1,200 vehicles will start to be delivered in 2015, and delivery should be completed by 2019."
02/12/2010,Commons,5,Stephen Barclay,North East Cambridgeshire,Con,"As part of completing the Thameslink project, will my right honourable Friend ask officials to look at the cost benefit  of extending the line beyond Cambridge to include areas such as Ely and Littleport on the way to King s Lynn, because the service is planned to stop at Cambridge, yet the cost of electrification beyond there would be   60 million to  80 million out of a  5.5 billion overall cost?"
02/12/2010,Commons,6,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"There are no plans to look at further extension of the Thameslink programme during the current control period but, as my honourable Friend will know, the next Network Rail control period begins in 2014, and proposals for infrastructure enhancements to the network beyond 2014 will be looked at and evaluated over the next couple of years."
02/12/2010,Commons,7,Mrs Louise Ellman,"Liverpool, Riverside",Lab/Co-op,It is apparent that the Thameslink project is essential for the cascading of rolling stock to the north. Can we be assured that that rolling stock will be of good quality and not simply cast-offs from Thameslink? How will the Secretary of State s statement about delays on Thameslink affect the north getting good-quality rolling stock to relieve overcrowding?
02/12/2010,Commons,8,Philip Hammond,The Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"As the honourable Lady knows, the cascading of rolling stock from First Capital Connect s existing operations to the north-west depends on the completion of the electrification programme in the north-west, which, as I indicated last week, is expected to be completed in 2016. By that time, rolling stock will have become available, so this does not involve any further delay. In terms of the quality of the stock, it is not, of course, new rolling stock, but it is good quality, with a significant remaining life expectancy."
14/07/2011,Lords,1,Lord Kennedy of Southwark,Lords,Lab,To ask Her Majesty s Government whether they will review their decision to award the Thameslink rolling stock contract to Siemens.
14/07/2011,Lords,2,Earl Attlee,Lords Spokesperson Department for Transport,Con,"My Lords, the competition for the Thameslink trains was designed and launched in 2008 in accordance with EU treaty obligations and UK public procurement regulations. I am satisfied that the proper process as originally advised to the bidders has been complied with. Both bids have been treated equitably and fairly in the process. The Siemens bid demonstrated that it offered better value for money against the published criteria and consequently the Government will not be reviewing the decision."
14/07/2011,Lords,3,Lord Kennedy of Southwark,Lords,Lab,"I thank the noble Earl for his response. When the Prime Minister and his colleagues came to Derby recently we heard lots about supporting engineering and manufacturing and creating jobs, but there is a wide gap between the words and the deeds. Why were the credit ratings of the two companies such a determining factor? This decision means that the last train maker in the UK a maker of quality products and inward investor to this country and the  1,500 people who will lose their jobs, whose families live in and around Derby, never stood a chance. That is a disgrace."
14/07/2011,Lords,4,Earl Attlee,Lords Spokesperson Department for Transport,Con,"My Lords, it is not for me to comment on the ability of bidders to raise the finance. However, the model selected by the previous Administration is a good one and we support it. It is important to remember that the Siemens bid will also create employment in the UK, although I have to accept that it will not be as much."
14/07/2011,Lords,5,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"My Lords, on Tuesday, the Conservative MP for Mid Derbyshire said:  Over the months   we have been waiting for the decision, I personally lobbied the Secretary of State for Transport   Unfortunately, he told me every   time that I was not to worry because Bombardier was fine   as the company had lots of orders and would have no problem going forward. That is clearly not the case, so he misread the situation. I hope that he feels somewhat apologetic about the decision ù. [Official Report, Commons, 12/7/11; col. 10WH.]"
14/07/2011,Lords,6,Lord Rosser,Lords,Lab,"That statement by the Conservative MP gives the game away. If the Secretary of State will not review the decision, what will he now do in negotiations with Siemens as the preferred bidder to maximise the number of additional jobs that it creates in this country to compensate for the thousands of jobs that will be lost in Derby and elsewhere in the rail supply chain as a result of the complacency and misjudgment which have now been revealed by one of his own MPs to have been behind the Secretary of State s decision?"
14/07/2011,Lords,7,Earl Attlee,Lords Spokesperson Department for Transport,Con,"My Lords, any job losses are highly regrettable. However, Bombardier has previously advised the department that it expected to make redundancies at this time regardless of the outcome of the Thameslink procurement order as Bombardier s Derby factory is currently operating at peak capacity and several of these orders come to an end later this year. Noble Lords will know that there are several other rolling stock procurement contracts in the offing."
14/07/2011,Lords,8,Baroness Kramer,Lords,LD,"My Lords, as I am sure the Minister will agree, it is crucial that we keep in this country the engineering skills to design and build trains. Are there any planned negotiations with Siemens and Hitachi to bring those kinds of jobs to the UK? In the case of Bombardier, has he considered extending some of its existing contracts, for example to provide electrical units to the train sets it has already built, and that are much needed on the Great Western, Northern and Southern lines and would help preserve that skill base in this country?"
14/07/2011,Lords,9,Earl Attlee,Lords Spokesperson Department for Transport,Con,"My Lords, on the last point, I am not sighted on that, but I will write to the noble Baroness if I have anything to add. There is an issue about the capacity for Bombardier to design rolling stock in the UK, but it is a matter for that company whether or not it maintains a capacity."
14/07/2011,Lords,10,Lord Pearson of Rannoch,Lords,UKIP,"My Lords, are the Government aware that under the EU treaties there is no enforceable sanction against a country that refuses  to pay a Brussels fine? So, why do we not behave like the French and award the Thameslink contract to Bombardier? Do the Government further agree that there would not even be the slightest risk, alas, that we would be ejected from the EU if we failed to pay any eventual fine? So, why do we not just go ahead and do it?"
14/07/2011,Lords,11,Earl Attlee,Lords Spokesperson Department for Transport,Con,"My Lords, the United Kingdom has never been fined in respect of an EU infraction and Her Majesty s Government have no intention of allowing that to happen. I hope that the noble Lord fully accepts the benefits of competition. It would be most peculiar to keep accepting bids that were not competitive."
14/07/2011,Lords,12,Lord Broers,Lords,Crossbench,"Does the Minister agree with me that this is just a symptom of a long-term problem whereby we have failed to co-ordinate our R&amp;D expenditures, our government procurement and our encouragement of industry to put itself in a competitive position? We really must co-ordinate these things across the board so that our bid is clearly the strongest. I declare my interest as chairman of the Transport Knowledge Transfer Network of the Technology Strategy Board, which is trying to do these things but with precious little resource."
14/07/2011,Lords,13,Earl Attlee,Lords Spokesperson Department for Transport,Con,"My Lords, the noble Lord makes an extremely good point. Another point concerns the need to schedule work such as rolling stock and other projects in order to avoid a situation of feast and famine. The McNulty report addresses that issue."
20/11/2012,Commons,1,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr Howarth."
20/11/2012,Commons,2,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"Bombardier is the last train-making company left in the United Kingdom. We have got to this state, frankly, if we go back into relatively recent history, because of the privatisation of the rail industry, which has led to an unco-ordinated approach to the procurement of trains and much short-termism. The train manufacturing industry in this country is left hanging in the balance."
20/11/2012,Commons,3,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"As a result of the Government s decision last year to appoint Siemens as the preferred bidder for the Thameslink contract, 1,440 jobs at the Derby Bombardier factory were lost. Some 1,600 remain, and 12,000 people work in the supply chain in the rail industry, which accounts for some 900 companies. Bombardier is therefore still a significant player, even though it is the last remaining train maker in the UK."
20/11/2012,Commons,4,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"I want to set out what I believe have been fundamental errors in the Thameslink procurement process. I also want to make the point I hope the Minister agrees that it is not too late to correct those errors. I hope, too, that he will give an assurance that the mistakes made in the Thameslink process will not be repeated in future contracts, particularly in the Crossrail contract that is due to come up in the next few years."
20/11/2012,Commons,5,Pauline Latham,Mid Derbyshire,Con,"Does the honourable Gentleman not want to look forwards, rather than totally backwards, and be positive? Does he not agree that further contracts, such as for Crossrail, are coming up, and that we should be careful not to jeopardise that by ranting on too much about the past. We should look forwards for Bombardier and ensure that we do everything, on a cross-party basis, to get it the contract for Crossrail."
20/11/2012,Commons,6,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"Of course, we need to look forward, and I shall come to that, but it is also important to look backwards for a while, because it is not too late for the Government to do the right thing. There are problems with and delays in the Thameslink contract, so it is appropriate to take that historical context into account."
20/11/2012,Commons,7,Dr Matthew Offord,Hendon,Con,"I thank the honourable Gentleman for securing the debate, which, as chairman of the all-party group on the Thameslink route, I particularly welcome. When he looks back, will he consider the previous Government, who designed the tendering process, and acknowledge the role that they played in this fiasco?"
20/11/2012,Commons,8,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"There is clearly a problem, and whoever is responsible is, in a sense, not really the point. I accept that there were clearly faults with the process designed by the previous Administration, but in taking account of the comment made by the honourable Member for Mid Derbyshire (Pauline Latham), it is important to look forward, while also acknowledging the impact of what we have seen over the past 18 months or so."
20/11/2012,Commons,9,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"Time is short, so I will try to motor along. I have a lot to say, and I want to give the Minister an opportunity to respond to my points. I was about to make the point  that we were told 18 months ago that preferred bidder status for the Thameslink contract had been conferred on Siemens. Before the 2011 summer recess, I was told by the then Minister of State, Department for Transport, the right honourable Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs Villiers), that the contract would reach financial close by the end of that year. She said that the Department could not countenance any further retendering of the process, because that would build in far too long a delay, which would impact on the infrastructure project. However, here we are, some 18 months later, and we do not seem to be that much closer to a final decision or the financial close on the award of the contract."
20/11/2012,Commons,10,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"In answer to a parliamentary question that I tabled, the Minister of State, Department for Transport, said that the DFT is now looking  to secure financial close early in the new year. ù"
20/11/2012,Commons,11,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"That will be well over the 18 months and getting on for two years, so I am not sure that the arguments made in the first instance hold any water."
20/11/2012,Commons,12,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"I have several questions that I hope the Minister will respond to if he gets the chance. Is he confident that the timetable will not slip yet again, because it has slipped time and again? Will he explain why the forecast date continues to slip, which is rather curious and which I do not understand? Will he tell the House whether he or the Department is aware of any problems with the proposed deal? Is the slippage caused by Siemens asking for more time, or are the delays caused by problems in his Department? Will he confirm that there will be no further slippage in the time scale? In which month in the new year will financial close eventually be reached? Will it be spring or earlier?"
20/11/2012,Commons,13,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"I want to go through some of the series of errors in the Thameslink tendering process, if I may. The contract is clearly a Government one, but the DFT has not managed it as though it were. Furthermore, the tender evaluation was discriminatory. The EU s Commissioner for the single market, Michel Barnier, has said that, as far as the Commission is concerned, the Thameslink contract is being undertaken by a contracting authority; in other words, it is a Government contract. The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, no less, has said that the consequence of the process  was bound to lead to the outcome it did. ù"
20/11/2012,Commons,14,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"The fact is that the Department is bound by regulations. As this is a Government contract, regulation 23 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 is relevant. It stipulates:  Subject to paragraph (2), a contracting authority shall treat as ineligible and shall not select an economic operator in accordance with these Regulations if the contracting authority has actual knowledge that the economic operator or its directors or any other person who has powers of representation, decision or control of the economic operator has been convicted of any of the following offences ù  including, among others   (a) conspiracy within the meaning of section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977  ; (b) corruption within the meaning of section 1 of the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889  or  ; (c) the offence of bribery ù, as well as various other offences."
20/11/2012,Commons,15,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"Paragraph (2), which is referred to, states:  In any case where an economic operator or its directors or any other person who has powers of representation, decision or control has been convicted of an offence described in paragraph (1), a contracting authority may disregard the prohibition described there if it is satisfied ù  this is the key point   that there are overriding requirements in the general interest which justify doing so ù."
20/11/2012,Commons,16,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"I would be grateful if the Minister explained what  overriding requirements ù led the Department to disregard the fact that Siemens has fallen foul of sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) in other words, corruption and bribery. I believe it is common knowledge that it has been found guilty of those offences in America and in its home country, Germany."
20/11/2012,Commons,17,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"Siemens AG is part of the Cross London Trains consortium, so the Department should have taken into account its obligations as set out in the regulations. Let me stress that I have nothing against Siemens per se, but I want to ensure that the law is applied appropriately and that the best interests of the United Kingdom, and of my home city and constituency of Derby, are served by the Government s decision."
20/11/2012,Commons,18,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"On the discriminatory nature of the matter, the process of evaluation is separated into four distinct component parts, or stages, which do not seem to be related to each other, and each part has to be satisfied in its own right. Once a bidding company has passed a stage, that stage is not referred back to, and it seems not to have any relevance to the next stage. I say that the process is discriminatory because, as experts agree, credit ratings are the key to the decision at the fourth, most important stage of the evaluation process; the quality of the product and the deliverability of the trains are utterly irrelevant. That process gave Siemens an unfair commercial advantage because it had a superior credit rating. The Department for Transport should urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to terminate the process and retender it on the basis that it was discriminatory and unfair."
20/11/2012,Commons,19,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,Another reason that the Department should consider terminating the process and starting again is that a number of civil servants who were suspended over the west coast main line debacle were also involved in the Thameslink process that was confirmed in responses from Ministers to written parliamentary questions that I tabled. That also flags up another significant question mark over the validity of the decision to award the contract to Siemens.
20/11/2012,Commons,20,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"Will the Minister give an unequivocal guarantee that Crossrail is being taken forward correctly? Are the obligations placed on contracting authorities being observed by his Department and by Transport for London? Will he confirm that the Crossrail tender evaluation criteria will be non-discriminatory and will not give an unfair financial advantage to any bidder based on their credit ratings? Moreover, will he assure us that the socio-economic factors have been included in the Crossrail invitation to tender, and if they have, how have they been included? Will he give us some information in relation to the proposed eVoyager contract, which is also really important to the future of the Bombardier factory in Derby?"
20/11/2012,Commons,21,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"Will the Minister put in place an independent inquiry to consider the workings of the Department for Transport with regard to the procurement of trains? From what we have seen over the past 18 months or so, it seems pretty obvious that there has been a problem with the way the Department for Transport approached the process."
20/11/2012,Commons,22,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"I have further questions for the Minister. What alternatives are being considered if Siemens is unable to reach financial close? In response to a written parliamentary  question, the Minister said that the Department was assessing other options in the event of it being unable to reach financial close with Siemens. What are those options?"
20/11/2012,Commons,23,Dr Matthew Offord,Hendon,Con,"In the next few moments, I will give the honourable Gentleman an opportunity to catch his breath and focus on some of his comments. He has presented an eloquent case for his constituents, and I would not take that away from him. None the less, I hope he agrees that I present an equally valid case on behalf of my constituents, who want a speedy resolution to the Thameslink project. That project is vital to them as it runs through the constituency."
20/11/2012,Commons,24,Dr Matthew Offord,Hendon,Con,"The honourable Gentleman started by saying that there were flaws in the process. So far, he has identified issues that he considers unfair; perhaps he is questioning their validity and clarity."
20/11/2012,Commons,25,Mr George Howarth,in the Chair,NA,"Order. An intervention should be just that, not a mini-speech. I hope that the honourable Gentleman is coming to the close of his intervention."
20/11/2012,Commons,26,Dr Matthew Offord,Hendon,Con,"Of course, Mr Howarth. My point is that the honourable Member for Derby North (Chris Williamson) has not identified any flaws in the tendering process. Will he address that matter, before the Minister rises to speak, by describing those flaws?"
20/11/2012,Commons,27,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"I am sorry if the honourable Gentleman has not followed my contribution, because I outlined what I consider flaws in the process. First, this is a Government contract and it has not been treated as such; it has been treated differently. Secondly, it is discriminatory, because it gives an unfair advantage to one of the bidders for the contract. The Government are under an obligation to ensure that there is a level playing field for bidders for such a significant contract, especially when the unfair advantage is given to a foreign competitor against our own British-based train-making company. Those are the flaws. Regrettably, we do not have time to go into further detail. If we had a longer debate, perhaps we could do so. I hope that the Minister will deal with those specific points."
20/11/2012,Commons,28,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"Let me return to the final few questions that I have for the Minister; I hope he will give them some attention. If the Department for Transport is unable to reach financial close with Siemens there seems to be a large question mark over that will Bombardier, as the reserve bidder, be automatically awarded the contract? Do alternatives that the Department is considering include allowing Siemens to build the trains and other organisations to provide the funding and finance? If Siemens fails to deliver on the Thameslink contract, will it be excluded from further bidding for the Crossrail contract? We deserve a response to that question, because there has clearly been a significant delay in the process. It would be inappropriate if Siemens were allowed to bid for another contract if it were unable to deliver on this one."
20/11/2012,Commons,29,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"If Siemens is eventually awarded this contract, will the Minister give a commitment and assure us that we will not see a repeat of what happened under the Intercity Express Programme contract? In that case, the Bombardier consortium and the Hitachi-led consortium put in bids on one basis under the original tendering process. After preferred bidder status was conferred on the Hitachi consortium, there was substantial and significant  change to the design of the IEP contract trains. That seems unfair, because, as I understand it, the design is now very similar to the offer that could have been delivered by Bombardier in the first instance, although it was not allowed to put that alternative design forward at that point."
20/11/2012,Commons,30,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"Time is short and the Minister has only 11 minutes left, although there are still quite a few questions that I would like to ask. I hope he can answer some of my questions, especially the one about considering putting in place an independent inquiry to look at the workings of the DFT in relation to the procurement of trains."
20/11/2012,Commons,31,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Thank you very much for calling me to speak, Mr Howarth. I will do my best in the 10 minutes or so available to try to answer as many points as I can."
20/11/2012,Commons,32,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"First, I welcome this debate on Thameslink and Crossrail, two schemes that are of great importance to this country s rail industry and, more widely, to supporting growth and jobs. I know that the honourable Member for Derby North (Chris Williamson) has been an active campaigner on behalf of Bombardier, which is natural, as it is situated in his constituency and city, and the company of course plays a key role in Derby s economy. I am pleased to respond to this Adjournment debate on a subject that I know is of great importance to him and his constituents. I am especially pleased to do so in the week after Southern announced that it intends to exercise an option for 40 new Electrostar carriages from Bombardier, which I am surprised he did not mention."
20/11/2012,Commons,33,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Let me start by saying that rail is a success story and this coalition Government is committed to continuing to invest in the success of rail. Since the 1990s, both the number of passenger miles and passenger journeys on rail have nearly doubled. In the same period, use of rail freight has expanded by more than 60%, and in the past decade we have seen significant increases in passenger satisfaction and train punctuality. However, this Government requires, and is driving, even more improvement. We are investing  18 billion in this spending review period alone on a programme of rail improvements as large in scale as anything seen since the 19th century."
20/11/2012,Commons,34,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"In Derby, the Department for Transport is investing in transport improvements, including investing  4.9 million from the local sustainable transport fund; more than  2 million from the better bus area fund; more than  8 million in highway maintenance and pothole repairs; and more than  9 million as part of the integrated transport block. We have also provisionally approved a  4.4 million contribution to a replacement road-over-rail bridge over the Derby to Birmingham railway line."
20/11/2012,Commons,35,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Thameslink is an urgently needed programme that will provide additional capacity for key London commuter routes and relieve overcrowding on the London underground. It includes major infrastructure works at key London stations, including the complete modernisation of London Bridge station and the procurement of next-generation rolling stock. In time, it will include changes to franchise arrangements to support delivery of the service."
20/11/2012,Commons,36,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Thameslink is already making a difference to passengers. Farringdon and Blackfriars stations have been transformed, platforms along the route have been extended to support new 12-car services, and enabling works have begun on the reconstruction of London Bridge station and its approach tracks. I take this opportunity to commend the industry, and especially Network Rail, for the work that has been done to upgrade Blackfriars, which was unique in scale and difficulty. I saw that work at first hand and thought that they did a fantastic job."
20/11/2012,Commons,37,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"As the honourable Gentleman highlighted, there have been delays in awarding the Thameslink rolling stock contract. The Thameslink train order is a significant investment and the detailed contract terms need to be right, so that we can meet the demanding customer and performance requirements of this next-generation rolling stock. The contract places much greater responsibility for the train s performance in service on the train manufacturer and maintainer than has been the case traditionally. That is the right thing to do, and given the size of this order, it takes time to get the detailed contract documentation completed. The Government is confident that it is very close to final agreement of these commercial arrangements, and we expect to be able to conclude the associated documentation by the end of this year."
20/11/2012,Commons,38,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"As the honourable Gentleman stated, we recently revised our target date for achieving financial close to early in the new year. Of course, agreement on financing has to come after agreement on commercial arrangements, and we have to allow a proper period for the rating agency and banks to perform their due diligence. As he will appreciate, the lending environment remains challenging for all projects. Notwithstanding that background, Siemens remains confident that the funds can be secured for Thameslink."
20/11/2012,Commons,39,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Members will know that the Government has recently paused existing franchise procurements, including for the new Thameslink franchise, while reviews take place of the serious errors that were uncovered on the west coast main line franchise competition. The Government is wholly committed to learning the lessons from that episode, but Members will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the findings of the independent inquiries looking into those matters."
20/11/2012,Commons,40,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Regarding train fleets, however, I am quite clear that the key features needed by the new Thameslink trains are those that support the demanding performance requirements needed to operate a high-frequency service through the central core between Farringdon and St Pancras of up to 24 trains per hour in either direction. Those are very different train performance requirements from those needed by trains on other routes operated by Southern. Hence, a different train fleet is required for Thameslink."
20/11/2012,Commons,41,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"There has been some question whether there will be sufficient electric trains from the existing Thameslink programme to support all the announced electrification schemes; I think the honourable Gentleman has raised that issue in parliamentary questions. Let me be clear that the Government s electrification programme covers both regional and commuter services, alongside long-distance, high-speed services for passengers and freight. The existing Thameslink rolling stock will be cascaded to regional and commuter lines, the very uses that it was designed to be suitable for. Overall, there is sufficient cascaded stock available to meet the needs of the electrification  programme. We are working with our industry partners to ensure that that rolling stock is made available in time for the electrification of the routes."
20/11/2012,Commons,42,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Thameslink is also good news for jobs. The rolling stock contract will support the creation of an estimated 2,000 jobs in the UK, supporting manufacture of train components, construction of depots and subsequent maintenance of the new fleet of trains."
20/11/2012,Commons,43,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,Will the Minister give way?
20/11/2012,Commons,44,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,I will give way shortly.
20/11/2012,Commons,45,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"In addition, at the peak of construction activity, we expect an additional 3,000 people to be employed directly on the Thameslink infrastructure works as a whole, with as many people again employed in related jobs in the wider community. I am happy to give way now to the honourable Gentleman, but he asked me a lot of questions and left me only 10 minutes to respond."
20/11/2012,Commons,46,Chris Williamson,Derby North,Lab,"I beg the Minister s pardon, but will he concede that the 2,000 jobs that he referred to a few moments ago would be created whoever won the contract, including Bombardier?"
20/11/2012,Commons,47,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,Of course I am absolutely happy to accept that. I welcome new jobs wherever they are created in this country. These are train-related jobs that help both the rail industry and the wider economy.
20/11/2012,Commons,48,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"At this point, I will try to answer some of the questions that the honourable Gentleman put. Some were related to the past, and I take the point made by my honourable Friend the Member for Hendon (Dr Offord) that the honourable Gentleman s speech was largely about the past, rather than the future."
20/11/2012,Commons,49,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"The honourable Gentleman asked specifically about Siemens and read out extracts from the legislation relating to the position that he thinks applies in this case. I should make it clear that for convictions to give rise to the requirement to exclude Siemens plc from the Thameslink rolling stock project, those individuals involved in the activities that resulted in convictions would need to be in a position of power, representation, decision or control of Siemens plc. The Department investigated the position at the pre-qualification stage and was satisfied that that was not the case. Consequently, we can reiterate that the Department does not consider there were grounds to exclude Siemens plc from the Thameslink rolling stock contract."
20/11/2012,Commons,50,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"The honourable Gentleman also mentioned Crossrail, of course, as he looked to the future. Before discussing Crossrail, I should finish talking about Thameslink by referring to the point made by my honourable Friend the Member for Hendon in an intervention on the honourable Gentleman. My honourable Friend s point was that Thameslink was largely done and dusted by the time that this Administration came to power and, to use the phrase that I think my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Defence used at the time, when he was Secretary of State for Transport, all he did was  open the envelope ù. That is the consequence of that particular process."
20/11/2012,Commons,51,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Moving on to Crossrail, the  14.5 billion Crossrail project will create vital new transport infrastructure to support economic growth. The project will deliver a 74-mile railway; 13 miles of new tunnels under London; new, expanded or upgraded stations along the Crossrail route; and a new fleet of trains. When the project is complete, Crossrail services will run from Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west to Shenfield and Abbeywood in the east. For the millions of people who will use its services, Crossrail will deliver faster journey times and better connectivity, while reducing overcrowding on other services. Overall, it will provide a 10% uplift in London s rail transport capacity. Crossrail is not only great news for passengers, but good news for the economy, as it will support growth and the UK s long-term competitiveness. Crossrail will provide 14,000 jobs at the peak of construction and is predicted to facilitate employment growth of up to 30,000 jobs by 2026."
20/11/2012,Commons,52,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"The Government, working with Transport for London as its co-sponsor, established Crossrail Ltd as a single-purpose delivery body for the Crossrail project. Crossrail Ltd is responsible for procuring the many contracts needed to deliver the project, the largest of those being the contract for an initial order of around 600 new carriages the exact number is a matter for the bidders and a new depot at Old Oak Common. The contract is expected to be worth in the region of  1 billion and is likely to include options to allow TfL to expand the fleet in future years to accommodate demand and respond to possible changes, such as High Speed 2. The procurement of Crossrail s rolling stock marks the beginning of Crossrail s transition from Europe s largest engineering project to an operational, world-class railway. These will be modern, high-capacity trains that replace many older, inner-suburban trains that run into Paddington and Liverpool Street."
20/11/2012,Commons,53,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Our priority is to deliver that new railway, which so many people are looking forward to, on schedule and to ensure that we do so as efficiently as possible, with value for money for the taxpayer and future fare payers always in mind. We are clear that we want to secure the right train at the right price to deliver the benefits of Crossrail to London and the south-east. The only way to achieve that is through a strong and fair procurement policy. Four bidders Bombardier, CAF of Spain, Hitachi and Siemens submitted first-round bids by the deadline of 29 October. I have no knowledge of what is in the bids, but I hope that Bombardier, along with the other bidders, has submitted a strong, competitive bid that meets the exacting requirements of Crossrail. I am sure that the honourable Member for Derby North would like us to follow proper EU procurement policy and rules."
20/11/2012,Commons,54,Norman Baker,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,LD,"Those first-round bids are being assessed by Crossrail Ltd. It expects to be in a position to shortlist bidders next spring, so as to move to the next stage of the competition. It is hoped that a preferred bidder will be announced later next year, with the project moving to financial close in 2014. The first train is expected to enter service between Liverpool Street and Shenfield the first section of the Crossrail route that will be operated by TfL in 2017. The full Crossrail service is expected to be fully operational in late 2019, with the central tunnel section opening in advance of that."
19/12/2013,Commons,1,Heidi Alexander,Lewisham East,Lab,What his Department s service specification priorities are for the new Thameslink franchise.
19/12/2013,Commons,2,Stephen Hammond,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"The Department s priorities are, of course, to ensure successful delivery of the  6 billion Thameslink programme, to maintain and enhance service quality for passengers while the Thameslink works are going on, and to bear down on the overall costs of running the industry."
19/12/2013,Commons,3,Heidi Alexander,Lewisham East,Lab,"I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Lewisham commuters are very keen to reap direct benefits from the new franchise and infrastructure programme through increased train frequency and capacity. Many people share the aspiration of having four trains per hour on the Catford loop. Can the service specification for the new franchise be changed at this late stage, and could such a service be accommodated without detriment to other Lewisham services?"
19/12/2013,Commons,4,Stephen Hammond,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"The Thameslink programme will be completed in 2018 and will, as the honourable Lady knows, provide a minimum of two trains per hour all day to stations on the Catford loop. That will be supplemented by additional standards and services under the Southeastern franchise, at least in peak periods. The detailed specification for those additional services will be determined nearer the time."
19/07/2017,Commons,1,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"I beg to move, That this House has considered Thameslink passenger services."
19/07/2017,Commons,2,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,A recent customer satisfaction survey on commuter trains by Which? ranked Thameslink third from bottom. Thameslink registered an approval rating of just 32%; it was ranked above only the beleaguered Southern and Southeastern. I want to make the Minister aware of that passenger dissatisfaction today and suggest some improvements.
19/07/2017,Commons,3,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"My constituents report cancellations and delays almost every day on the network. Over the last twelve months, trains have been plagued with technical problems. One constituent told me that last year alone he counted 15 broken-down trains on his journeys, including two on the same day, 14 August. Cancellations are often made at short notice. They cause later trains to be extremely busy, which makes it difficult for passengers to get on or off, giving rise to what have been called cattle-truck conditions and meaning that trains often cannot stop at their planned stations. Constituents tell me that on a bad day, which is not unusual, it takes them about two hours to get from London to St Albans, despite the 19 to 22 minutes timetabled for peak-time journeys. I have been told of constituents who have given up their jobs because they cannot afford the extra childcare some nurseries charge an extra  50 per hour s delay or are unable to see their children in the evening. Many are consistently late for work despite leaving home earlier and earlier."
19/07/2017,Commons,4,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"The Train Suffragettes are 500 mostly female parents in my constituency who were so fed up with the poor service they receive that they set up a group to show their collective unhappiness. They have shared with me their terrible experiences trying to balance work in London with family life in St Albans. They have missed school plays and parents  meetings and rarely get to put their children to bed. Persistent delays have driven many of them to quit their jobs, and some have even moved away from the Thameslink line altogether. One mum told me:"
19/07/2017,Commons,5,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con," After calling in favours too many times from too many people and being late for nursery pick-ups three times in one week alone (once where I was actually stuck on the train for an hour with no phonourable signal and so unable to call anyone at the nursery), I quit my job in the city in October. Financially a difficult decision but I d had a skinful of the stress of the commute, wondering if my train home would be on time or if I would have to sprint from the office to get the earlier train, which was often cancelled too. ù"
19/07/2017,Commons,6,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"A lot of technical problems have been reported with the new Siemens 700 trains, mainly with electrics, software and heating. The doors often fail to open, especially at St Pancras, because they are now controlled by the driver; one day a train sat at the station for about 20 minutes because the driver could not open the doors. I know that Thameslink is aware of those problems. There has been some welcome recent progress, including an increase in Govia Thameslink s public performance measurement from 60% to 83%, but that is still well below the national average of 88.95%."
19/07/2017,Commons,7,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"Over the last year, Network Rail was responsible for 54% of delays, Thameslink for 42%, and other causes for 4%. We appreciate that ongoing Network Rail works  have an impact on the line, but that is no excuse for rail services not to provide a reliable timetabled service or to try to deliver improvements to it. My constituents not only suffer a poor service but get far less generous compensation than Southern Rail passengers when incidents occur. That cannot be acceptable. Network Rail should have better lines of communication with Govia and passengers. People need to know as quickly as possible why they have been delayed and what they can do to avoid disruption."
19/07/2017,Commons,8,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"In the 2016-17 financial year, one in 11 trains run by GTR was cancelled or more than 30 minutes late the worst performance of all the rail operators in the country. In period 3 of 2016-17, GTR had a cancellation and significant lateness percentage of 15.7%, compared with a 5.7% national average. In period 3 of 2017-18, GTR had a considerably reduced failure rate of 6.6%, but that is still nearly double the national average of 3.7%."
19/07/2017,Commons,9,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"In my first debate on this matter in 2012, I said that First Capital Connect, which then held the franchise it has now been replaced by Govia was ranked  lowest in the country, including value for money, punctuality, sufficient room on trains, satisfaction with the stations and how the train operating companies dealt with the delays. ù [Official Report, 2 February 2012; Vol. 539, c. 342WH.]"
19/07/2017,Commons,10,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"Five years on, despite the change of franchise, nothing has changed. GTR still consistently ranks among the operators with the lowest customer satisfaction public performance measures."
19/07/2017,Commons,11,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"The failings that other honourable Members and I raised five years ago remain failings today. Something must be done to improve Govia passenger services for all those who rely on them. It is a simple premise that to deliver an efficient, mobile workforce, we need a decent, well run and affordable rail transport service. People of all ages expect a rail service fit for the 21st century. The travelling public are being asked to pay ever more for their rail fares, and we in Parliament must ask serious questions about the services they are experiencing up and down the country."
19/07/2017,Commons,12,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"I could not speak in a debate on commuter train services in my constituency without referring to the shadow being cast by the Radlett rail freight proposal, which my honourable Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Oliver Dowden) and I believe may have a catastrophic impact on the already hugely inadequate commuter service. The application for this strategic rail freight site started in 2006. In December 2016 10 years after assurances were given that access would be granted Network Rail said that it would be in a position to confirm an  efficient scheduling strategy ù once the capability and capacity analysis team completed its evaluation. However, it responded only last week, and its response, which was about essential works disruption and pathing, raises far more questions than it answers."
19/07/2017,Commons,13,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"The Government s national policy statement on national networks in 2014 identified London and the south-east as the areas with busiest passenger services, with passenger carriage set to increase by 46.1% by 2033. Moreover, the Department for Transport s 2016 rail freight strategy said:  Rail freight services operate in response to customer and supply chain demands, making it more challenging to plan for freight services than passenger services, which tend to run to a regular timetable and route. ù"
19/07/2017,Commons,14,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,Commuters in my constituency certainly wish passenger services would run to a regular timetable and route.
19/07/2017,Commons,15,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"Will the Minister guarantee that the proposed strategic rail freight interchange will not add further delays and cancellations for my constituents, who are already at breaking point? Will he undertake to scrutinise any plans to deliver the site link tunnel, and will he test those plans against the potential disruption to services? I am concerned that the significant rail works necessary to deliver the site will mean a protracted period of disruption that cannot be justified by the site s limitations. In case the Minister is not aware, the site is in a village with no motorway access. It has a life span of 30 years and is constrained from expansion, unlike the expansion forecast for passenger services. This inadequate proposal cannot be allowed to interfere with the exciting prospect of better and more frequent passenger services for my constituents."
19/07/2017,Commons,16,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"What can be done to improve the current situation? Commuter groups such as the Train Suffragettes in St Albans have suggested changes that would go a long way towards improving the overall service that passengers receive. The first is a consistent and user-friendly refund system to allow passengers to reclaim expenditure, including taxi costs incurred because of delays and cancellations. The second is opening station ticket barriers when there have been delays, in order to ease platform congestion, which is often described as being at a dangerous level."
19/07/2017,Commons,17,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"The third suggestion, which is vital, is to improve communication at all levels. Passengers are fed up with being in the dark when trains have been delayed or cancelled. They have suggested following the model of the London underground, where as I am sure the Minister is aware when a tube is held in a tunnel, the driver immediately makes an announcement to let passengers know the reason for delay and how long a wait is anticipated. When a tube station is closed, the driver will helpfully suggest alternative connecting routes for passengers."
19/07/2017,Commons,18,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"The fourth suggestion, which is regularly raised, relates to communication between drivers and staff at stations St Albans station in my case. Passengers need to be able to speak to station staff to find out exactly what is going on and what has caused the delay or cancellation."
19/07/2017,Commons,19,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"Finally, passengers demand that fares be reduced, or at least frozen, until Thameslink vastly improves the service on the line. I called for the same thing in 2012, but five years later the catastrophic situation that my constituents are experiencing is exactly the same. We also face the impact of the strategic rail freight interchange s disruptions being put into the mix. I suggest that we are on our knees in St Albans, and the Minister needs to take drastic action now."
19/07/2017,Commons,20,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Bailey. I congratulate the honourable Member for St Albans on securing the debate; it is a welcome opportunity to raise the misery being caused to my constituents as a consequence of the failures of our rail services."
19/07/2017,Commons,21,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"It is hard to overstate the cumulative impact of failing rail services on my constituents in Dulwich and West Norwood over the past two years. The honourable Lady mentioned the bottom three franchises for customer satisfaction  being Southern, Southeastern and Thameslink. Those are the only franchises that operate in my constituency, so we have, on different parts of the route, different combinations of misery. Commuting by rail from my constituency is a universally difficult and miserable experience."
19/07/2017,Commons,22,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"The debate is focused on Thameslink passenger services, which I will return to in a moment, but it would be remiss of me to contribute to a debate on one part of the GTR franchise without putting on the record the utter misery caused to my constituents who travel on Southern Rail services, which are also run by GTR. I have heard from almost 2,000 constituents over the past 18 months about the catastrophic impact that the collapse in Southern rail services has had on their employment, family life and wellbeing."
19/07/2017,Commons,23,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"The Government s response to Southern Rail s problems has been, frankly, too little, too late. While everyone understands that many of the problems can only be resolved through infrastructure investment, there is much more that can and should be done in the short term to provide passengers with timely information about delays and cancellations, and to re-establish effective negotiations with the trade unions to address the safety concerns that have been raised and to resolve the industrial dispute. The fact that the chief executive of GTR, who has responsibility for the Southern Rail franchise as well as Thameslink services, received a pay package of almost half a million pounds last year simply adds insult to injury for my constituents."
19/07/2017,Commons,24,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"Thameslink services run through Tulse Hill, Herne Hill and Loughborough Junction stations in my constituency, in addition to peak-time services through Sydenham Hill and West Dulwich. Those services are vital for people who work in areas of central London, including Blackfriars, Farringdon and the City of London, or areas of intensifying employment, such as King s Cross and Old Street, or those who need to access the tube network from Elephant and Castle. I was a Thameslink commuter to Farringdon, and then to Blackfriars, for the best part of 20 years prior to being elected to Parliament."
19/07/2017,Commons,25,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"Thameslink services have been becoming more overcrowded and less reliable for many years. Passengers who use stations in my constituency have suffered the consequences of residential densification further down the line, meaning that it is now often impossible to get a seat or even to stand comfortably on trains that were not previously so full. With the exception of Herne Hill station, which has lifts, the stations in my constituency are not accessible. Loughborough Junction is a particularly challenging station to use, with very steep steps and narrow, windswept platforms. At peak times, passengers at Loughborough Junction are often unable to board trains at all because they are so overcrowded. The Loughborough Junction area is currently subject to considerable new residential development, increasing the number of homes in the area. New homes are badly needed, but they must be supported by investment in transport infrastructure to ensure that everyone in the community can continue to get to and from work and to access the services they need."
19/07/2017,Commons,26,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"The current services are also desperately unreliable. There are delays and cancellations every day, and my constituents are forced to organise their lives in order to  mitigate the impact of services they should be able to rely on. New rolling stock is slowly being introduced, and while to some extent those trains provide a more comfortable environment with more standing space, they are often just as overcrowded as the old ones. There is a view among many passengers that they should have been designed like Overground trains, with seating at the sides, to allow much more space for passengers who have to stand. We need 12-car trains across the network and investment to ensure that they can be accommodated at every station to maximise capacity for passengers."
19/07/2017,Commons,27,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"I am also concerned about the potential loss of the direct service from my constituency to Luton airport. My constituents will now only be able to access that really important service by changing at Elephant and Castle, where trains are even more overcrowded. I am concerned that fewer trains will stop at Tulse Hill, Herne Hill and Loughborough Junction overall as a consequence of the timetable changes, in a situation where we need capacity to be increased, to cope with both current and future demand."
19/07/2017,Commons,28,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"I am concerned that services currently run by Thameslink through Sydenham Hill and West Dulwich stations and not included in the current consultation may be lost if, in the Southeastern franchise renewal process, they are not considered to be sufficiently profitable. Those services are small in number but provide a vital route to work for many of my constituents. We need much more ambitious investment in rail infrastructure than is currently proposed to meet the transport needs of my constituents, as both our local population and the population further out of London on the same commuter lines continue to grow."
19/07/2017,Commons,29,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"I have the following asks of the Minister today. The experience of the failure of the temporary timetable on the Southern network into London Bridge tells us that the robustness of the timetable in relation to the capacity of the network is a paramount consideration for reliability. When will the Minister confirm the capacity of the Thameslink core in relation to the proposed new timetable? Will he commit to exploring the reopening of Camberwell station between Loughborough Junction and Elephant and Castle stations, to provide extra capacity and a modern, fully accessible station environment to serve local residents, staff and patients travelling to King s College Hospital and students travelling to the University of the Arts London sites in Camberwell and Elephant and Castle?"
19/07/2017,Commons,30,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"Will the Minister commit to ensuring there is no drop in the number of services through Loughborough Junction, Tulse Hill and Herne Hill stations following the consultations on the new timetable? Will he commit to securing the future of services to Blackfriars from Sydenham Hill and West Dulwich? Will he commit to exploring the reopening of the eastern platforms at Loughborough Junction station, to enable trains to stop there between Denmark Hill and Elephant and Castle? That would double capacity at Loughborough Junction station. Will he commit to working with Transport for London to open an Overground station at Brixton East, between Denmark Hill and Clapham High Street stations, to relieve pressure on the Thameslink network?"
19/07/2017,Commons,31,Helen Hayes,Dulwich and West Norwood,Lab,"Will the Minister work to persuade the Secretary of State, who has not previously been inclined to do so, to work in a cross-party way with the Mayor of London to transfer all suburban rail services in south London to  Transport for London to run, so that profits can be reinvested in the improvements we so urgently need, rather than being used to reward the poor performance of senior leaders in the private sector? Finally, can the Minister tell my constituents when they will be able to rely on rail services to run to the agreed timetable, without delays and cancellations, and when they can stop having to organise their lives around the failures of the GTR franchise, including the Southern railway?"
19/07/2017,Commons,32,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"May I begin by thanking you for your chairmanship, Mr Bailey? I pay tribute to my honourable Friend the Member for St Albans (Mrs Main). I know what a doughty campaigner she has been on this topic. My remarks are only intended to echo some of the points she has made, and indeed some of the points made by the honourable Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes)."
19/07/2017,Commons,33,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"I should begin by declaring an interest: I commute, for my sins, on this line every day, so I have first-hand experience of it, but also a desire to improve it, as do many of my constituents. Literally thousands of my constituents commute every day from Radlett and Elstree and Borehamwood on that line into central London. They, like other honourable Members  constituents, have sorry tales to tell of the poor performance of the line."
19/07/2017,Commons,34,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"I will give a few statistics. At times last year, less than two thirds of Thameslink trains ran on time. Almost one in five trains were cancelled or significantly late. The level of frustration and volume of correspondence that I received in relation to that poor performance led me eventually to compile a dossier of more than 100 complaints from constituents, which I was able to present to the Transport Secretary. They were very similar to the complaints outlined by my honourable Friend the Member for St Albans. The most distressing cases were those of people who felt they had to give up their jobs because they could not rely on the service, and of younger mums and dads struggling with childcare. We know what it is like with childcare we think we are going to pick our kids up at a certain time, so we allow, say, an hour for the train journey, but it takes two hours. The nursery is closing, and the level of stress involved if family or friends cannot pick our children up is enormous."
19/07/2017,Commons,35,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"Commuters in my constituency are seeking a number of reassurances. I know that many of these do not fall within the direct purview of the Minister they fall within the purview of the franchisee but I hope he will be able to bring some pressure to bear on the franchisee in relation to them. Specific points that constituents have asked me to raise include the problem of trains switching at the last minute. I have seen that: people get on a train thinking it is an all-stopper or a semi-fast train, and literally moments before it is about to depart, they suddenly discover that it is either not going to stop where they thought or stopping at every stop. Communicating that effectively to commuters is very important. My honourable Friend drew the comparison with London Underground. Thameslink has been improving a little in this respect, but there is still a lot more it could do to keep passengers up to date with what is going on as it happens. If people know what is happening, it makes things that bit easier. Even if it just involves sending someone a text to say they will be late, it makes it a little easier."
19/07/2017,Commons,36,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"There is also tremendous variability in the length of trains. There can be a full platform waiting for an eight-car train and suddenly there is a four-car train that not everybody can get on. A perennial bugbear for my constituents although I admit it probably runs contrary to the interests of my honourable Friend s constituents is that too few trains stop at Elstree and Borehamwood and Radlett, instead running directly to St Albans. When there are delays on the line, my constituents are just looking to get home, and in those circumstances they would look for trains stopping every time. I would be grateful for an update on anything the Minister can do to raise the pressure on that."
19/07/2017,Commons,37,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"There is also a broader question about the infrastructure. A great number of my constituents drive to and park at the station. In both Elstree and Borehamwood and Radlett there are single-tier carparks. I simply do not understand why another level or two cannot be put on those carparks. Given the incredibly high parking fees charged by Thameslink, it would be in its interests to construct other levels. I am interested in the Minister s perspective on that. As the honourable Member for Dulwich and West Norwood said, as the level of densification in these areas of the south-east inevitably continues to rise, the demand for the station will only continue to grow. Equally, there is the issue of capacity at the station. I am grateful for the Government s progress on Borehamwood station they have announced some additional funding, which is very gratefully received but that money needs to continue to flow so that we can keep up with the ever-rising demand."
19/07/2017,Commons,38,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"I echo the concerns about the pricing of the railway line. By many measures, this is the most expensive railway line per kilometre travelled not only in the United Kingdom but in the whole of Europe. If passengers are being forced to pay that much, the service really does need to improve to match it. I know that anything the Minister can do to keep pressure on the company to find further efficiency savings to keep the cost of commuting down would be very gratefully received by constituents."
19/07/2017,Commons,39,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"It is also important to look at what happens when things go wrong. As my honourable Friend the Member for St Albans alluded to, the compensation scheme is still not simple and transparent enough, and does not cover a lot of the on-costs. For example, if the line is down, my constituents living in Radlett or Borehamwood often have no alternative than to go to the very end of the Jubilee line and then take a taxi from Stanmore. That is in no way covered in the compensation scheme. It is a completely unavoidable cost for my constituents, and that should be considered."
19/07/2017,Commons,40,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"It is also important to look not just at the franchisee but at Network Rail. Too often, we concentrate on the failures of the franchisee, not those of Network Rail. It is to the Government s great credit that when faced with a dire financial situation in 2010 they decided not to cut back on railway investment. They kept the investment going for Crossrail and for the rather unfortunately named Thameslink 2000 programme. We are hopeful that Thameslink 2000 will be delivered by 2020, but that process has necessitated considerable upgrades at London Bridge. That was clearly necessary, but it has had a bad knock-on effect on commuter services, because capacity has been significantly reduced around the station. I would be grateful for an update from the Minister about  progress on that upgrade. When can we expect London Bridge to be completed, and when can we expect trains to start fully running through there?"
19/07/2017,Commons,41,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"An issue has been flagged to me that I would be grateful if the Minister took very seriously. Capacity in the London core of Thameslink will be effectively doubled overnight when trains go up the northern stretch on which my honourable Friend s and my stations lie not just towards Bedford, but to Hitchin and Harpenden. That will mean huge pressure through the central core. At times, there could be trains every minute or two minutes. I know the system will be computerised, but I would be grateful if departmental officials stress-tested the system before roll-out so that we do not face a cliff edge. After all the pain, the moment the system at St Pancras is not working my honourable Friend alluded to this we would not want to go back to square one again and have a complete failure of the service."
19/07/2017,Commons,42,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"I would be grateful if the Minister updated me on plans to integrate between franchisees and Network Rail, as announced by the Secretary of State. That is important. One of the problems of privatisation was the artificial distinction, and it is important that we close that distinction. An update would help us understand how that can be addressed in the longer run."
19/07/2017,Commons,43,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"Let me quickly turn to two final issues. There is a desperate need for the Oyster card system to be extended to Radlett. I know the Minister is on the case, but an assurance from him to my constituents that that will be delivered by 2018 would be gratefully received and the same goes for Potters Bar, which is not on Thameslink but is served by Govia Thameslink, the wider holding company."
19/07/2017,Commons,44,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"We cannot discuss rail freight without looking at the rail freight terminal: the disastrous development that is entirely unsuited to our part of Hertfordshire. My honourable Friend the Member for St Albans and I continue to campaign against it, but if it is to go ahead, we must look at its impact on the railway line. At the meeting we both had with Network Rail, it updated us that the development will involve putting a line under the existing line to access the rail freight terminal. When we think about the infrastructure involved in building one railway line under another, it is difficult to conceive that that will not involve significant delays. I would be grateful for an update on that and, in particular, an assurance that the full cost will rightly be borne by the developer, and that means minimising disruption to passengers, even if that means a higher development cost. Given all that we have heard, it is simply not fair for commuters to bear the cost in terms of delayed journeys for the developer to get a cheaper deal."
19/07/2017,Commons,45,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"Equally, I would be grateful for some reassurance on timetabling. I know Network Rail s argument is that there are already allocated slots, but those slots are not being used by freight trains at the moment. I fear we will lose capacity once they are being used continuously by the rail freight terminal. Some reassurances would be gratefully received."
19/07/2017,Commons,46,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"I thank the Minister for coming here. I was on the radio just now talking about this, and the interviewer said,  This is the last day of term. You will all be watching videos, relaxing. ù I trust that the Minister will completely disprove that and demonstrate that he will address this issue with vigour."
19/07/2017,Commons,47,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Bailey, in this crucial debate. We have seen the passion presented by all honourable Members on the challenges that their constituents face not just day by day, but week by week, month by month and year by year. The sheer dissatisfaction, frustration and misery that commuters have had to put up with for such a long time shows that resolution is crucial. The passenger must be listened to. We have obviously heard about the disruption brought not only to the commute, but to family life. I give all credit to parents who try to arrange childcare under the best of circumstances, but when they face an unreliable train service as well, the pressures are immense. All honourable Members have articulated that well this afternoon."
19/07/2017,Commons,48,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"When passengers turn into activists and take action against what should be a normal part of their routine and daily life such as the Train Suffragettes and others I know as well it really shows that the whole rail system is in meltdown and has to be addressed. As we have heard, it is not just about train operating companies, because this has been a sustained problem across the network for such a long time. However, Thameslink particularly stands out. It has the second-lowest level of passenger satisfaction, at 73% only Southern, at 65%, is behind and has issues with punctuality and reliability, as we have heard. Southeastern trains are also not delivering for passengers, which is now spreading to Northern as well. With regard to Thameslink, things have not improved for several years now. When a staggering 23% are satisfied with how the company has dealt with delays, it really shows that it is left wanting, as has the whole situation."
19/07/2017,Commons,49,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"What we have really picked up on today are the consequences of that unreliability, the infrastructure problems, the desperate need for investment and the massive overcrowding issues. The overcapacity issue will not going away, as more housing developments will put further strain on the network. We have also heard about challenges with the choice of destination, the obvious need for improvements right across the network and the impact that late or cancelled trains have on commuters."
19/07/2017,Commons,50,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"It is important that we listen to these real frustrations. We cannot allow the situation to continue in which the Government point fingers but do not lift one to sort out what is happening. We know that there is real chaos in the way the franchise was set up, as was rightly highlighted when the Gibb report was debated in the main Chamber on 4 July. We know that there needs to be effective governance over the whole structure, which has been lacking, to ensure that issues are addressed expediently and that proper dispute resolution mechanisms are put in also. At the forefront of everything, we need to make sure that passengers  concerns are addressed and that their safety is safeguarded. We also heard about access needs, and the fact that some train journeys are simply impossible for passengers with disabilities."
19/07/2017,Commons,51,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"Another point that was rightly raised was the financial cost to passengers. We have seen rail prices go up by 27% since 2010 on this rail network, which is the most expensive not only in the UK but in the whole of Europe, meaning that passengers are having to pick up the cost of this failed network. We are expecting further price increases in August, and we have heard the figure  of 4% perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on that. We need certainty on pricing; all passengers, whether on Thameslink or other networks, really want to know what is happening on pricing. The Opposition believe that price rises should be capped in line with the consumer prices index. We have heard different answers from different Ministers from the Department: we have heard that price rises will continue to be capped in line with the retail prices index; we have heard twice from the Minister that pricing is under review; and we have also heard that things will be kept as they are this year but that does not say what will happen next year. Passengers need clarity on pricing."
19/07/2017,Commons,52,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"We need to make sure that we move forward with smart ticketing, which we heard several contributions on. Where are we at with part-time smart ticketing, which will impact on many of those parents? It is an equality issue and we need to move forward on it. We also need to make sure that we see greater flexibility in smart ticketing, including the extension of the Oyster card. With the technology that is in place, how is delay repay being rolled out on the Oyster card? There are opportunities there. Of the amount of money that the network gains, only a minimal amount reaches the customer. The process of trying to reclaim after a delay is difficult."
19/07/2017,Commons,53,Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Con,"The honourable Lady is absolutely right. Many of my passengers say that they do not want to have to claim; they simply want the service they have paid for. Delay repay is better, but on the other hand the service needs to improve, because otherwise they just get money back for a bad service. That is not what they want; they want the journey they were guaranteed."
19/07/2017,Commons,54,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"I completely agree with the honourable Lady. However, we also need to ensure that, where there has been a delay, passengers are properly compensated, given that they have paid so much for the privilege of travelling on that network. Between 2010 and 2015, the train operating company generated  575 million from Network Rail for infrastructure delays, yet only  73 million went to passengers, so we have to question who benefits. Again, it comes back to governance over the system, which is poor. That comes up many times. It is a theme that is repeated in every aspect of how the franchise works. The franchise has failed passengers. We need to see delay repay extended so that the customer can be compensated automatically, as opposed to trying to seek out that compensation."
19/07/2017,Commons,55,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"We also need to look at what has happened with the Thameslink programme. It was first put in place in 2006, so those years are moving forward. We need to see that the objectives now being met are not at the inconvenience of passengers such as major track work, signalling and station remodelling, improvements to the lines approaching London Bridge and the overhead lines north of St Pancras. The programme was very ambitious, but without proper governance it has not been realised. On the issue of capacity, as 24 trains an hour move through the core of central London, the risks increase. We cannot even get the service moving right at the moment. We need to hear from the Minister what mitigation is being put in place to reduce risk and ensure that trains run on time and that passengers reach their destinations on time. About 14,500 additional passengers will use that network."
19/07/2017,Commons,56,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"The Gibb report goes further on the issues that need to be addressed across the networks. It also addresses GTR s responsibilities and Network Rail. The issues it identified include rail renewal, switching and sleeper renewal. The list goes on to talk about telecoms and cable signalling and dealing with things such as vegetation, earthworks and fencing it is comprehensive. We need to ensure that the improvement programme is put in place and delivered by 2018. We do not want the stop-start approach to maintenance and development. We want to see the investment running into the CP6 funding round from 2019. What exactly is the Minister doing to make sure there is ongoing investment in the railway?"
19/07/2017,Commons,57,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"We must thank Chris Gibb for his report, but we must also note the responsibility to move forward on many of the problems experienced across the Thameslink network. We also need to address the issues raised by the Transport Select Committee, which has identified how poorly the franchise has been established. The relationships do not work between the train operator, Network Rail and the passenger. That must be put right. Changing an operator does not change the environment, which is so important. It is right that the Committee highlighted the problems with the initial structuring of the franchise, the inadequate planning that was put in place, weaknesses in the franchising handover period, infrastructure and rolling stock failures, mismanagement, and poor industrial relations."
19/07/2017,Commons,58,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"I want to talk about industrial relations, because it is so important that these issues are addressed. We have people working on the rail network who are seriously concerned about passenger safety and access. We have heard about the overcrowding, which increases risk, and the real challenges on the network. More commuters will be using the line and it is vital that public safety comes first. The unions have been clear that this is not a dispute about money; their concern is about public safety."
19/07/2017,Commons,59,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"I have spoken to train drivers in the last couple of days, and they say it is vital that they have a second pair of eyes. If they miss something, the other person can help pick it up. They say it is vital that there is someone there to deal with incidents, whatever they may be, because it is unpredictable. It could be a driver falling ill, a fatality on the rails, a terrorist attack, derailment or a crash, women s safety at night or antisocial behaviour disturbing other customers. Of course, guards play a much wider role in maximising revenue collection and providing passengers with a wider service. We have heard today how important that service is, particularly with the line of communication, which a number of honourable Members have mentioned. They can let passengers know information, be the first port of call and be the passengers  champion when needed."
19/07/2017,Commons,60,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"I urge the Minister to address those vital issues. We must get the rostering right to ensure that the trains run on time and address the issues in this dispute. This is not rocket science; the dispute is simple to resolve. I know, as a negotiator, that the Minister just needs to sit down and make sure the guards are in place and can continue with their role. It is incumbent on him to sort this out. I know it is not beyond his wit, and I trust he will do so."
19/07/2017,Commons,61,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"In conclusion, we have heard about the painful experiences of commuters. We must remember that the whole rail network is there as a service a public service to help passengers continue with their employment  opportunities and their daily lives. It is absolutely right that focus is now brought on the way the franchises and relationships are not operating and that that is worked through, to bring the service back to customers. That is why the Labour party believes that public services now need to be a public accountability, in public ownership. For far too long, decisions have been made away from the passenger. We want to see the passenger at the heart of those decisions, putting safety and service needs at the forefront and building the structures around the passenger."
19/07/2017,Commons,62,Rachael Maskell,York Central,Lab/Co-op,"I have heard all the frustrations, and Labour will take those on board and work with passengers to make sure that we can provide the service needed in the future. We will keep the pressure on the Government, as the passengers  voice throughout this process."
19/07/2017,Commons,63,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Bailey. I congratulate my honourable Friend the Member for St Albans (Mrs Main) on securing this debate and presenting her case, as she always does, with great vigour and force; I expect no less from her. She is right to hold Ministers to account for the service on her railway."
19/07/2017,Commons,64,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"Passengers expect a timely, punctual and reliable service, and when they do not get it, they are right to want to understand why, and what Ministers and the train operators intend to do about it. This has been a helpful debate on what is occurring with Thameslink, and I am grateful to both the honourable Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes) and my honourable Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Oliver Dowden) for their contributions. There was also a sensible contribution from the shadow Minister, the honourable Member for York Central (Rachael Maskell). We may not agree on the final paragraphs of her speech, but I thought that much of what she said made great sense."
19/07/2017,Commons,65,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"I am aware of how important it is that we deal with this issue. As I said, passengers want a service that they can rely upon, and if they cannot, that should be a concern for us all. The Thameslink service is vital for our country, not least because our capital city depends upon it. Reliability of services through central London is critical. It is one of Europe s busiest rail routes, so it is right that passengers will see new stations and better stations, in fact new trains, new infrastructure and new systems to increase capacity, reduce crowding and provide better connections for passengers across London and the wider south-east."
19/07/2017,Commons,66,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"A number of points have been made in the debate, but I want to focus first and foremost on answering the points made by my honourable Friend the Member for St Albans. I often find that these one-hour debates are neither fish nor fowl, and I want to give proper attention to the points made by the Member who secured the debate without ignoring the other points made. Normally I run out of time in that ambition, so if I do not manage to respond to all the points now, I ask Members to make sure that I reply to them all subsequently."
19/07/2017,Commons,67,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"The first point made by my honourable Friend the Member for St Albans was about the impact of the new trains. Of course, people want new trains. It is right to point  out that the new Thameslink trains have advanced technology; they are more spacious and modern by their very definition. We have contracted Siemens to deliver 115 of them overall. We have 37 currently in service, between Bedford and Brighton, on the Wimbledon loop and on services in Kent. We expect all Thameslink services to be served by Class 700 trains by October 2017."
19/07/2017,Commons,68,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"Train performance on the brand-new trains is improving bit by bit every period, but I recognise that it has not been good enough. I have spoken to Siemens myself to urge improvement. I know that it is working very closely with GTR. With every software improvement we see a significant improvement, but it is worth bearing it in mind that this platform is a step beyond what Siemens has produced before with its Desiro platform. There will always be slightly more challenges with such a new piece of rolling stock, but we are seeing significant improvement over time, and I fully expect to see significant improvement in reliability over the coming weeks."
19/07/2017,Commons,69,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"My honourable Friend the Member for St Albans gave a number of examples of where her constituents were not getting the service they desire. I have been hearing those tales about this GTR network since I started in this role last July, and that is what has inspired me to focus on trying to deliver the rail ombudsman that we had in our manifesto as rapidly as I can. That is making good progress. I want to ensure that passengers can get binding arbitration at the end of the day where they cannot secure the right outcome from their appeals. We do not want these situations to occur far from it but where they do, I want the passenger to feel empowered. That is why I wanted to ensure that we had passenger representation on the Gibb report panel, for example to ensure that their voice was being heard."
19/07/2017,Commons,70,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"I was fascinated to hear about the Train Suffragettes to whom my honourable Friend referred. I would be delighted if she could send me more of their ideas about how the service could be improved, and I would be happy to take on board as many of them as possible."
19/07/2017,Commons,71,Oliver Dowden,Hertsmere,Con,"I should also highlight Thamestink, which is the campaign group in my constituency. I would be grateful if the Minister could extend the invitation to that group as well."
19/07/2017,Commons,72,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"I always risk creating extra work for my private office in inviting all submissions, wherever they are from, but I am more than happy to receive them and give them my full attention."
19/07/2017,Commons,73,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"A number of honourable Members mentioned what is referred to in the industry as passenger information during disruption. It has been a major concern of mine that passengers may, at the breakfast table, consult their mobile phonourable, get one piece of information that their train is running, beetle down to the station to get the train and then discover that for some reason it has been cancelled. There are too many sources of information across the industry. The Office of Rail and Road has two key obligations under law. One is improving passenger information during disruption. I have asked it to look closely at how that is working across the south-east quadrant as a whole, because I have concerns about both GTR and Southeastern ensuring that we have consistent information. I accept that that is a key point, and it is one that I am taking up."
19/07/2017,Commons,74,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"My honourable Friend the Member for St Albans has raised concerns both with me and with my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State about the Radlett freight interchange. Those representations were augmented today by my honourable Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Oliver Dowden). I genuinely recognise those concerns; that is why I want to ensure that the timetable is protected from the impact of the works. Network Rail has reassured my Department, just as it has reassured both my honourable Friends, that the work at Park Street has been planned to have minimum impact on passengers, as freight trains will run only outside peak times and overnight, but I recognise that the concerns remain and that there is a wish to have greater oversight of the detail of what is being planned. I suspect the best thing I can offer is to broker a meeting with Network Rail, with me present as well, and perhaps we can test some of those assumptions against what my officials and the Department are also aware of. That might be of assistance to my honourable Friend the Member for St Albans, so we will co-operate as best we can to try to find that reassurance."
19/07/2017,Commons,75,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"My honourable Friend also mentioned overcrowding at St Albans station. We are extending the platform to accommodate 12-carriage trains as part of the Thameslink programme. GTR is working to deliver extended automatic ticket gates at platform 4, which I believe is called the Ridgmont entrance, by 2019. The main station building will also receive an enhanced retail offering, a larger concourse area to accommodate peak periods and associated platform furniture and shelter facilities to improve the station environment. I recognise that there remain capacity concerns at St Albans station. We are thinking through the implications of that for future rail control periods."
19/07/2017,Commons,76,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"In terms of future Thameslink services and how they will benefit St Albans, it is a matter of improved peak frequency and more capacity between central London, St Albans and Bedford, with more peak services, new cross-London routes, and Thameslink services reinstated to serve London Bridge. I expect passengers to see more comfort benefits, with more than 3,000 standard-class seats into London St Pancras, which is 15% extra from today, particularly through using the 12-carriage trains."
19/07/2017,Commons,77,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"Essentially, Thameslink is all about expanding capacity on a key commuter route. We are trying to deliver the trains and the infrastructure to enable that, with 24 trains an hour in the peak through the Thameslink core between Blackfriars and St Pancras, which is an additional nine trains in each direction."
19/07/2017,Commons,78,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"Part of our focus is on making sure that we have the right infrastructure not just track but signalling. My honourable Friend the Member for Hertsmere is right to identify that we need to make sure that signalling and timetabling are robust. We have a planning board, chaired by Chris Gibb, of Gibb report fame, and an assurance panel, chaired by another industry expert, Chris Green, double-checking the work that is going on to make sure it is reliable and will deliver the outputs that we seek."
19/07/2017,Commons,79,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"To date, the Thameslink programme has delivered a new Blackfriars station connecting both side of the Thames. We have seen major enhancements at Farringdon, platform extensions on midland main line stations to allow longer trains and, as I said, 37 of the new class 700 trains. There are new maintenance depots at Three Bridges in Crawley and Hornsey in north London, and  many honourable Members will be familiar with the new London Bridge station, two thirds of the concourse of which has been open since August 2016."
19/07/2017,Commons,80,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"What else can passengers expect? The rest of London Bridge station will be open for business in early 2018. The new class 700 trains will start operating on Great Northern routes and on services in Kent and Sussex. Entire new journeys, such as Cambridge to Gatwick, will open up new journey options and connections for customers, including an interchange with the Elizabeth line services at Farringdon, which I think will transform how people approach travel options within London. Most importantly, from 2018 there will be services every two to three minutes through the central London core between Blackfriars and St Pancras International."
19/07/2017,Commons,81,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"I recognise concerns about performance. We have seen performance steadily improving since the start of the year. When we are able to focus on improving the network, rather than just on industrial relations, we can deliver a real improvement in performance, working together with the drivers. The jump in public performance from 62% last December to a high of 85% this year reinforces that point, but I recognise that we need to do better 85% is still not good enough. We continue to have an immense amount of pressure on the network."
19/07/2017,Commons,82,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"We are also looking carefully at the future Thameslink timetable. Journeys will be improved with better travel across the network, but modern track will make journeys more reliable and new trains will provide additional capacity. GTR has been actively seeking feedback from any interested parties on the timetable changes to make sure that they best match passenger need. The second stage of the consultation has just closed and we are looking carefully at what people are saying."
19/07/2017,Commons,83,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"As I mentioned earlier, our Thameslink industry readiness board, chaired by Chris Gibb, is doing important work. Thameslink brings many other franchises on to its network, and the board is looking at making sure we maximise the potential for all aspects of the train network."
19/07/2017,Commons,84,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"My honourable Friend the Member for St Albans mentioned delay repay, as did the shadow Minister. We have brought  delay repay 15 ù specifically into GTR as the first franchise to trial it, because we recognise the impact that the disturbances across the network as a whole have had. I share the concern that we need to explain more carefully that the impact of Thameslink is not just felt south of London. It is often hard to envisage how Thameslink is a regional service. What occurs north of London has an impact south of London and vice versa. It is worth highlighting, for example, that right-time presentation, as we call it in other words, the right-time arrival of the train at the station is rarely higher than 50% on services from the north of London going south through to Brighton. That indicates that problems in Brighton on trains going northwards also impact on punctuality and reliability, so investment in both sides of the central core is absolutely crucial."
19/07/2017,Commons,85,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"We have improved delay repay, although I take on board the point about improving its delivery. We have to be careful about our terminology, as I have learned. Automated compensation is about improving the behind-the-scenes progress of individual train operating companies. It is about someone getting their compensation without doing anything to achieve it. That requires them to demonstrate that they have been on the train in question. They can either nominate their usual commuter train,  in which case it can be automatic compensation, or, where they have not specified a train, they must prove that they were on the delayed train. There is sadly a risk of fraud, and we are talking about considerable sums of money from regular commuters, so there has to be that element of assurance."
19/07/2017,Commons,86,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"I share the ambition of the honourable Member for York Central, which is why I have been pushing for delay repay to be rolled out as much as possible. Passengers have a right to expect it. We need to be much better at making people aware of it and confident about using it. I would rather, as my honourable Friend the Member for St Albans said, that there were no delays at all; then we would have a better service in the first place."
19/07/2017,Commons,87,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"As I often mention, there is a  300 million investment in improvement across the Thameslink network. Not all of that is occurring south of London. Hon. Members may think this an issue just on the Brighton main line, but it is not. We are investing in additional land sheriff shifts to reduce trespass and railway crime across the entire length of the line, and there will be more use of predict and prevent condition-monitoring software and processes on the infrastructure. There will be additional incident response teams and embankment works at New Barnet. All of that is occurring north of London on the stretch that covers St Albans. Because of the point I made earlier about interaction, service delays, either north or south, inevitably have an impact on St Albans at some point."
19/07/2017,Commons,88,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"We will continue to deliver that  300 million until December 2018, when we cease the current control period. We will need to invest further in control period 6, and we will be making future announcements about how that spending will be allocated. We are committed to doing what is needed to bring this stretch of track up to the standards required to deliver timely and punctual rail services."
19/07/2017,Commons,89,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"I will try to make a bit of progress, because I recognise that I have not covered any of the points made by the honourable Member for Dulwich and West Norwood. I am not sure whether the shadow Minister had time to be briefed on this before she arrived here, but there will be talks tomorrow at the Department involving GTR, ASLEF and, I think, the RMT I am not sure whether that is precisely correct. Hopefully, that will be an opportunity to have the discussion the honourable Lady is aiming for."
19/07/2017,Commons,90,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"I do not think anyone disagrees that having a second person on board is a bad thing. We have been able to have a second person on board across the network  where GTR is in operation. That is a good thing in my view. The issue will be the circumstances in which a train may depart if someone is not available. That is the narrow point that was in dispute in the past, and perhaps tomorrow will be the chance to resolve that we will have to wait and see."
19/07/2017,Commons,91,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"The honourable Member for Dulwich and West Norwood made a number of perfectly relevant suggestions. I am not sure I can do them justice in two minutes, but if it would be helpful to her I would like her to come to see me and my officials to go through them in more detail. I am aware of schemes such as the expansion of Loughborough Junction and Camberwell, and she deserves a better response than me saying,  We will look at it. ù If she gets in touch, I will be more than happy to meet her. I know the Secretary of State met the Mayor yesterday and had constructive discussions."
19/07/2017,Commons,92,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"On the honourable Lady s point about resilience, we are already seeing greater resilience through a re-diagramming of services. Part of the problem is drivers joining and leaving a service as it passes through the GTR network. By simplifying the diagrams with the agreement of the drivers, we can make for a more resilient service by ensuring that that interruption is reduced."
19/07/2017,Commons,93,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"I noted the points made by my honourable Friend the Member for Hertsmere. We should not overlook the fact that GTR was criticised in the Gibb report as was the Department. We saw penalties imposed on GTR last week, which will go towards improving the network. This is not just about trade unions, GTR or the Department; it is about an entire ecosystem, as some have pointed out. I heard my honourable Friend s point about car parking, and I know the rail delivery group is looking at that. The passenger s experience begins when they decide to make a journey, and that includes car parking."
19/07/2017,Commons,94,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"Vertical integration is moving according to plan. We have already seen some of the benefits for this franchise of getting Network Rail and GTR to work more closely together and of continuing to work with TfL on the Oyster zone, which should help my honourable Friend s constituents in particular. One highlight of the last week was the rail delivery group s announcement of new statistics on right-time arrivals at stations, which I urge all honourable Members to have a look at."
19/07/2017,Commons,95,Paul Maynard,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,Con,"If there is anything I have missed, I ask Members to get in touch. We will keep Members informed."
